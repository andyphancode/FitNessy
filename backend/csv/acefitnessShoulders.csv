Starting Position: Place your feet securely into the foot cradles positioned directly under the anchor point. Apply downward pressure with the tops of your feet by plantarflexing your ankles (toes point away from your shins). Gently lie flat on your stomach with your hands placed shoulder-width apart, under your shoulders and facing forward. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles (""bracing""), and your glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles).
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press yourself upward until your elbows are fully extended, aligning your head and spine (avoid any sagging or aching in your low back or hips hiking upwards). Keep your feet together throughout the exercise and avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Maintaining your rigid torso, inhale and slowly lower your body towards the floor, touching your chin or upper chest to the floor. Again, avoid any arching or sagging in your low back.
Step 4
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by lengthening the straps and positioning your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX.
Using the TRX certainly enhances the appeal of many exercises; however, trainers and individuals should not participate in these advanced exercises until they can demonstrate capability to effectively stabilize their lumber spine (low back) with their core muscles.

Starting Position: Holding the TRX handles or foot cradles in each hand, turn yourself to face the anchor point with your feet wider than hip-width and both facing forward. Bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while maintaining your weight over your heels and using the TRX to assist you keep your balance. As your lean backwards, extend your arms forward at chest height with palms facing towards the floor. Keep your head up, looking forward throughout this movement.
Step 2
Rotation Movement: Exhale and slowly rotate your arms at the shoulders without turning your head until you reach a point of tension. The leading arm will rotate behind your torso while the trailing arm will simply move across the front of your body. Hold briefly, inhale, then exhale and rotate in the opposite direction.
Step 3
Exercise Variation (1): To progress the exercise and mimic the golf swing more closely try moving your feet together and change your starting position where you are not bending over, but assuming a slightly bent-knee (1/4 squat) position. Extend your arms forward towards your knees rather than to chest level (pushing down on the handles of foot cradles) and rotate as described above. This rotation will exhibit more pivoting off the back foot. Change your head position to look towards the floor.
Step 4
Exercise Variation (2): Progress the movement to a windmill to increase torso rotation for your golf swing. From the same starting position described in the first progression, rotate both arms together in each direction while keeping your head fixed and facing the floor. This movement will exhibit a greater degree of pivoting off the back foot.
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it requires additional attention to proper form.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs bent slightly deeper than 90 degrees at the hips, knees bent to 90 degrees, and feet overlapping each other.  Align your hips and shoulder vertically with the floor and spine and head in a straight line.  Extend your lower arm in front of your body at chest level, resting it upon the mat while reaching with your upper arm down under your trunk to firmly grasp your ribcage.  Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk by pulling the ribcage around with your upper arm.  Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, (indicated by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate).  Continue rotating your trunk until your reach the point of tension, avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  The deeper bend at the hips and abdominal stiffening will help prevent any arching in your low back during the stretch.  Grasping under your ribcage will ensure rotation, and stretching of, your trunk and reduce shoulder stress that often occurs when the arm is extended and allowed to fall towards the floor (refer progression).

Step 3
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then repeat to the opposite side.

Step 4
Progression 1: Extend the lower leg, while resting the inside of the upper knee on a small riser.  In this position, the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk, evidenced by a backwards slide of the upper knee during the rotation.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips while only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.

Step 5
Progression 2: Remove the riser under the upper knee and place it firmly against the mat / floor.  In this position, the upper knee may rise off the floor and the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips by pressing the knee into the floor and only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.

Step 6
Progression 3: Repeat the same exercise, but begin with both arms extended in front of your body at chest level.  As you begin to rotate, bend the upper elbow, sliding it towards your trunk, then extending the arm outwards again at chest level as you continue your rotation.  Continue your rotation until the point of tension in the trunk and shoulder, but avoid arching your back or rotating your hips. This will increase the stretch in the shoulder and chest region, in addition to your trunk.

To maximize the benefits of this stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to follow the instructions provided carefully.

Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) over the top of a properly-inflated stability ball (one that compresses approximately 6"" under your body weight) with both feet and hands on the floor, hip- and shoulder-width apart. 

Step 2
Gently contract your abdominal/core muscles to stiffen your torso and slowly walk backwards until your stomach lies directly over the top of the ball with both legs extended and both feet firmly placed on the floor, hip-width or wider apart. Your torso and legs should be in parallel alignment with your arms, resting on the ball. 

Step 3
Start with your scapulae in a retracted and depressed position (shoulders pulled down and back) without any arching in the low back while performing the formations listed in the subsequent steps. 

Step 4
""I"" Formation: Exhale, fully extend both arms and slowly raise them overhead (in line with your torso) in unison until they lie level with your torso. Your thumbs should point towards the ceiling (palms facing each other). Avoid any shrugging in your shoulders. Hold this position briefly, inhale and slowly return your arms to their starting position 

Step 5
""Y"" Formation: Exhale, fully extend both arms and slowly raise them in unison at a 45 degree angle from overhead until both lie level with your torso. Your thumbs should point towards the ceiling. Avoid any shrugging in your shoulders. Hold this position briefly, inhale and slowly return your arms to their starting position. 

Step 6
""T"" Formation: Exhale, fully extend both arms and slowly raise them out to your sides in unison at a 90 degree angle to your body until both lie parallel with your torso. Your thumbs should point towards the ceiling. Avoid any shrugging in your shoulders. Hold this position briefly, inhale and slowly return your arms to their starting position. 

Step 7
""W"" Formation: Exhale, bend your elbows, raise your arms level with your torso and push your elbows backwards towards your hips in unison. Your thumbs should point towards the ceiling. Avoid any shrugging in your shoulders. Hold this position briefly, inhale and slowly return your arms to their starting position. 

Step 8
Exercise Variation: To increase the balance challenge, this series of exercises can be progressed by bringing your feet together behind you or raising one foot off the floor. 

Avoid hyperextension in your low back by raising your torso past parallel alignment with your legs.

Your head, torso and legs should be in parallel alignment with your arms resting on the ball.
Step 3
Place your hands to the sides of the ball close to the top, positioning your hands directly under your shoulders and elbows by your side. Think about trying to squeeze the ball between your hands to create more strength and stability.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press your body upwards until your elbows are fully extended, but not locked. Maintain your head, torso and leg alignment, and elbows by your sides. Hold this position briefly.
Step 5
Downward Phase: Inhale and gently lower yourself to your starting position.
Step 6
Exercise Variation (1): If this body position proves too difficult in pressing upwards or in stabilizing your torso, take yourself down to a kneeling position, aligning your head, torso and thighs throughout the exercise.
Step 7
Exercise Variation (2) : To increase the balance challenge, this exercise can be performed by bringing your feet together behind you and raising one foot off the floor.
Avoid hyperextension in your low back by allowing your low bag to sag towards the floor. Your torso and hips should remain rigid and in parallel throughout the exercise.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs extended so that your hips and shoulder are aligned vertically with the floor and your spine and head are in alignment (head resting on the mat or upon a small pillow or rolled-up towel). Bend your upper leg to create a 90-degree bend at both the hip and knee, resting the inside of that knee upon the mat or upon a raised platform, (e.g., rolled-up towel, block, etc.). Extend both arms out directly in front you at chest level, overlapping your fingers together.  

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine in a neutral position and maintain this throughout the exercise. Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk and upper arm until your belly button faces the ceiling and your upper arm extends out to the side, either touching or being elevated slightly above the floor. 
Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, evidenced by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate.  Placement of a raised platform under the inside of the upper knee will help control this hip rotation.  Additionally, avoid any arching in your low back that may accompany the rotation. Stiffening (""bracing"") your abdominal muscles will help prevent this.   

Step 3
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.  Hold this position briefly, then flex (bend) the elbow of the lower arm so that the back of the arm rests against the floor / mat, while the forearm is aligned vertically to the floor.   Extend the other arm vertically towards the ceiling, but do not allow the scapula to move (i.e., hold it in the depressed and retracted position). 

Step 4
Gently exhale and while stabilizing your scapulae (shoulder blades), trunk and hips, perform a series of push-pull movements with your arms:
(a) Press the lower arm upwards, extending the elbow without allowing the scapula to move forward
(b) Pull the upper arm downwards towards the chest, flexing (bending) the elbow without allowing the scapula to move backwards.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: The exercise intensity can be increased by using dumbbells.
 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stabilize the scapulae, trunk and hips and control movement at the shoulders.  Follow the instructions provided carefully.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place one hand on the top of medicine ball and the other on the floor. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart. Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing""). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your torso to rotate, your low back or hips to sag or pitch upwards. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thighs) to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back or hips to sag or hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
As the ball adds instability to this exercise, your movements need to be slow and controlled to reduce the chance of injury.

Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on a mat in a bent-knee position and place a small pillow, rolled-up towel or foam pad under your head.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise. While holding a light dumbbell or weight in one hand, press that arm vertically while maintaining a neutral wrist (i.e., wrist aligned with your forearm) and scapula (shoulder blade) in contact with the mat.  Place your opposite arm at the side of your body.

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and maintain this throughout the exercise. Gently exhale and rotate your trunk and legs slowly towards the arm placed at your side while keeping the extended arm vertical to the floor at all times and the upper shoulder stable (i.e., no movement of the shoulder blade).  Continue to rotate until your belly button is level with the floor. This places a significant stretch and increased load into the upper shoulder.  Control movement (stabilize) in this shoulder and avoid any arching in your low back that may accompany the rotation.  Stiffening (""bracing"") your abdominal muscles will help prevent this.   

Step 3
Pause momentarily then slowly return back to your starting position.  Perform 1 set x 5 – 10 repetitions at a slow, controlled tempo (pace), then repeat to the opposite side.  

Step 4
Exercise Variation: If a light dumbbell is not available, perform this exercise without any resistance or with any weighted device. The exercise complexity is increased by holding a kettle bell that has an “offset center of mass.” 
 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stabilize the scapula and control movement carefully.  Follow the instructions provided carefully

Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on the floor / mat in a bent-knee position with feet placed firmly on the floor.  Position your arms to your sides with elbows extended and palms facing inwards.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this positions throughout the exercise.
Step 2
“I” Formation: Gently exhale and slowly extend your arms overhead keeping your elbows extended, while maintaining your depressed shoulder position and stable spine (avoid arching your back). Individuals experiencing some limitations in their flexibility will tend to shrug their shoulders and arch their back during this movement.  Continue to move your arms overhead until your thumbs touch the floor overhead, or until you reach the point of tension, but avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions.
Step 3
“Y” Formation: From the same starting position, gently exhale and slowly extend your arms into the “Y” formation (45-degree angle to form the letter “Y”) as illustrated, while maintaining your elbows extended, depressed shoulder position and stable spine (avoid arching your back).  Continue to move your arms until your thumbs touch the floor in the “Y” position, or until you reach the point of tension, but avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions.
Step 4
“T” Formation: From the same starting position, gently exhale and slowly raise your arms until vertical with the floor, then open up to your sides into the “T” formation (90-degree angle to form the letter “T”) as illustrated, while maintaining your elbows extended, depressed shoulder position and stable spine (avoid arching your back).  Continue to move your arms until the backs of your hands touch the floor in the “T” position, or until you reach the point of tension, but avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions.
Step 5
“W” Formation and Wipers: From the same starting position, flex (bend) your elbows and externally rotate (turn out) your arms until the back of your forearms touch, or come close to touching the floor (forming the letter “W” as illustrated), while maintaining your elbows extended, depressed shoulder position and stable spine (avoid arching your back).  Gently exhale and slowly slide your arms overhead along the floor while maintaining your bent-elbow position until your hands touch above your head or until you reach the point of tension, but avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain (sometimes referred to as “snow angels”).  Hold both the “W” and overhead positions for 10 - 15 seconds then relax and slide your arms back to your “W” formation.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions.
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions in each formation, holding the end position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 
EXERCISE TIP: To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, attempt to keep your scapulae (shoulders) depressed and avoid arching in your low back.

(b) Sit upright off the backrest, which will require a greater effort from your core to stabilize your trunk as you perform the press movement.
 

In the overhead position, the shoulder is relatively unstable. To protect your shoulder it is important to engage your lats (back muscles) to initiate the downward movement as oppsed to simply yielding to gravity. This will help stabilize your shoulder.

Starting Position: Grasp the dumbbells in your hands and sit with your back against a back rest so that your head, shoulders and butt make contact with the bench. Place your feet firmly on the floor. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing""). If working with a spotter, signal for assistance. Exhale and slowly lift the dumbbells to your shoulder level with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward and thumbs wrapped around the handles), with the dumbbells at shoulder-width or slightly wider and wrists in a neutral position (avoid flexion and extension of the wrists). Retract and depress your scapulae (pull down and back) and hold this scapulae position throughout the exercise. 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and press the dumbbells overhead in unison until your elbows are fully extended without any arching in your low back. Maintain your body contact with the bench, neutral wrist (avoid flexion and extension) and depressed, retracted scapulae positions. For more comfort through the range-of-motion keep your elbows pointed in front of you. 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in a controlled manner by flexing (bending) your elbows while maintaining a rigid torso, neutral wrists and contact with the bench and floor. Avoid simply yielding to gravity and consciously try to contract your lats and pull the dumbbells down towards you. 
Spotting is important to ensure safety in this exercise. The spotter should stand behind you in a split-stance position, positioning their hands close to your wrists (not touching) to support you as needed.

Starting Position: Sit with your back firmly supported against the backrest. Adjust the seat height so that the handles are level with your shoulders or just higher than your shoulders. Grasp the handles closest to your body firmly with a full grip (thumbs clasped around the handles) and maintain a neutral position with your wrists (i.e., wrists in line with your forearms).  Position your elbows pointing towards the front of your body (i.e., not in the traditional 3 and 9 o'clock positions where the elbows are aligned with the midline of your trunk).  This position shifts more of the load into the triceps and away from the shoulders.  Position your feet firmly on the floor or on the foot rests to stabilize your body.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the backrest.  Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly perform an upward pressing movement, extending your elbows overhead while maintaining a neutral wrist position, head aligned with your spine and avoiding arching your low back.

Step 3
Continue pressing until your elbows are fully extended, but not locked.  Pause momentarily then gently contract your lats (back muscles) to pull the handles back down towards your starting position, allowing your elbows to flex (bend) in a slow, controlled manner while returning to their starting forward-facing position. Repeat the movement.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity, perform the following variations:
(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) presses
(b) Sit upright off the backrest, which will require a greater effort from your core to stabilize your trunk as you perform the press movement.
 

This position is more comfortable and less stressful on the shoulders and more appropriate for individuals who experience some discomfort when performing traditional shoulder presses as it shifts more load into the triceps. In the overhead position, the shoulder is relatively unstable. To protect your shoulder it is important to engage your lats (back muscles) to initiate the downward movement as oppsed to simply yielding to gravity. This will help stabilize your shoulder.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you.
Step 2
Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"") and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase, contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to create stability for your core. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or be allowed to flare outwards slightly.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. As your press upwards, extend your left hip to lift your left foot off the floor, keeping the knee extended. Attempt to avoid rotation in your hip as you raise the left leg off the floor. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows and your left leg is extended off the floor. Hold this position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat with your opposite leg
Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and holding a medicine ball in both hands directly in front of your chest; grasp the ball with your hands in a neutral position (palms facing each other), and elbows fully flexed (bent) and facing down towards the floor. 
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) and engage your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and support your spine. Maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and reach the medicine ball back between your legs to prepare to bring it up overhead in a rapid motion.  
 
Step 3
Upward phase: Swing the medicine ball upwards over your head while reaching it back behind your head and neck and simultaneously straightening your legs and rolling up on the balls of your toes to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension); lean back while pushing the hips forward to lengthen the abdominal muscles, keep the abdominals contracted and engaged (bracing) throughout the movement to ensure spinal stability.  
Step 4
Explosively bring the ball down over your head to throw it directly downwards into the floor while dropping your weight back into your hips.  As you throw the ball down, make sure you are maintaining the abdominal bracing and hinge from the hips to maintain spinal stability.
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Use a bouncing medicine ball to throw it straight down and have the ball bounce back up into your hands to perform continuous repetitions. 
If using a bouncing medicine ball make sure that you have ample space for safety; if you are using a non-bouncing medicine ball (a ""dead"" ball) make sure you are on a solid, stable floor that can support the force of the weight being thrown explosively into the floor.

Keep your feet pressed into the ground, continue to contract and brace your abdominal  muscles, swing your arms upwards to lift the medicine ball overhead and bend your elbows to reach the medicine ball behind your head.  As you lift the ball over your head, shift your weight back into your right leg and lean back to engage the core muscles for extra power for the throw.  While preparing to throw the ball aim the throw by keeping your eyes on your partners hands as you pull the ball back over your head.
 
Step 3
Explosively step forward with the right leg and quickly bring your arms forward over your head to generate power for throwing the ball.  While stepping forward with the right leg, push the left leg into the ground create triple extension (ankle plantar flexion with knee and hip extension) and generate more forward momentum for the ball. 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: Repeating throws: Use a wall with a medicine ball capable of bouncing and position yourself so that you can throw the ball into the wall and quickly catch it to prepare for the next throw. 
The purpose of this exercise is to generate upper body power, use a ball that is no more than 10% of your bodyweight to ensure that you can acheive the appropriate velocity for the throw.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms on the sides of a medicine ball. Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing""). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during the downward phase. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
Step 4
An alternate ball with handles can be substituted that reduces the pressure on your wrists. When using this type of ball, maintain a neutral wrist position throughout the exercise.
As the ball adds instability to this exercise, your movements need to be slow and controlled to reduce the chance of injury.

Before you begin make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, (let the partner feel the medicine ball first so he or she knows how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it) or be sure that you have a solid wall or medicine ball rebounder that can withstand the forces of impact from a medicine ball.  
Starting Position: Stand on the floor in an athletic ready position with both feet hip-width apart, position your body directly facing your partner (or wall / rebounder), your should be at least 5-8 feet away from your partner and each partner should maintain the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest lifted up, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).   Firmly hold a medicine ball between both hands right in front of your chest; contract and brace the abdominals and keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes.  Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target. 
 
Step 2
The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, the hips slightly flexed, the abdominals engaged and both hands held straight in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball.  The person throwing the ball should step forward with the right foot into a forward lunge, as the right foot hits the ground bend your left knee to allow you to sink into your right hip simultaneously push the medicine ball away from your chest to throw it directly to your partner. 
Step 3
The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of his or her body, as the medicine ball hits the hands, allow it to decelerate towards the chest.  Once the catching partner catches the medicine ball he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge to throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw who should be standing with the hips flexed, both feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of his or her body to prepare to catch the ball.  
Step 4
The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched hands prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge. 
Step 5
The partner catching the ball should first catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement.  Perform a number of lunge and throws stepping with one leg before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward with the other leg.
Step 6
Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge. 
 

During the entire thowing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner's hands to ensure good aim).

Starting Position: Grasp two dumbbells and lie supine (on your back) on a flat bench with your feet placed firmly on the floor or upon a raised platform to allow you to maintain a neutral (flat to normal) spine. If working with a spotter, signal the spotter for assistance in handing you the dumbbells.
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) to make firm contact with the bench. Your head, shoulders, butt and feet should make contact with the bench and floor/riser throughout the exercise. Signal the spotter for assistance in moving to the starting position. Grasp each dumbbell with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward, thumbs wrapped around the handle), pressing the dumbbells to a position shoulder-width apart with your elbows extended. Externally rotate the arms (rotate your elbows to face outward and palms to face inward), slightly flexing the elbows, but maintaining a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion/extension at the wrist joint).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in unison in a wide arc until they lie level with your shoulders or chest. Keep the dumbbells parallel with each other during the movement. Maintain your slightly flexed elbows, neutral wrist position and contact of your head, shoulder, butt and feet with the bench and floor/riser.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells upward in a wide arc back to your starting position, keeping the elbows slightly flexed, wrists neutral and making contact with the head, shoulders, butt and feet with the bench and floor/riser.
Safety is very important in this exercise. A spotter should adopt a split-stance position or half-kneeling position with the hands positioned as close to the most distal (wrist) joint. Keep the hands near, but not touching the wrists unless needed.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet together. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Hold a light-to-moderate weight medicine ball in front of your chest with both hands firmly holding on to the ball. 

Step 2
Step forward slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg.  Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and press the left (stance / supporting) foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (forward) leg with the foot placed firmly on the floor, think about lowering yourself into your hips by allowing your weight to shift downwards towards the floor instead of forward. As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (supporting) foot. While simultaneously lowering yourself into your right leg and hip, lift your hands holding the medicine ball straight overhead while continuing to maintain the abdominal bracing.

Step 3
While in the bottom (downward) phase of the lunge, pull the medicine ball back down towards your chest, continue to maintain a stiff core and drive your right foot into the ground to extend the right knee and straighten the leg to return to the original (starting) position of standing with both feet under the hips and the ball held in front of the chest.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time. 

Step 4
Exercise Variation: Begin with a light-weight medicine ball in order to learn how to maintain stability all of the way through the movement.  To increase the level of difficulty and to improve core and shoulder strength, once you can perform 8-12 repetitions on each leg, increase the weight of the medicine ball.  Another option is to hold one dumbbell in each hand, start with the elbows bent at ninety degrees and tucked in to the side, at the bottom of the lunge, bend the elbows to bring the weight up to the shoulders and press it directly overhead.

Starting Position: Stand holding dumbbells in your hands with a closed, neutral grip (thumbs around the handles and palms facing your body). Position the dumbbells alongside your thighs with your elbows extended or holding a slight bend. Assume either a split-stance position to stabilize your body or position your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart.
 
Step 2
Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal and core muscles (""bracing""), and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back), maintaining this position throughout the exercise. Your head position should be aligned with your spine.
 
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells up and out to your sides. Your elbows and upper arms should rise together and be slightly ahead of your forearms and dumbbells. As your arms move past 60 - 70 degrees (nearing shoulder level), rotate them slightly upwards so that the front edge of the dumbbells point slightly upwards. Continue raising the dumbbells until your arms are level with your shoulders and approximately parallel with the floor. Maintain your torso erect (no arching your low back) and neutral wrist position (avoid flexion and extension of your wrists).
 
Step 4
Downward Phase: Inhale and gently lower the dumbbells back towards your starting position keeping your elbows slightly extended and holding the neutral grip position. Maintain your foot, torso, shoulder and wrist positions while lowering the dumbbells and rotating them slightly downwards as your arms pass that 60-70 degree mark.
As this exercise traditionally positions the arms into internal rotation during the lift, the slight external rotation initiated at the 60-70 degree mark may reduce potential impingement in the shoulder joint.

Starting Position:  From a standing position with your feet together or slightly apart, stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.   

Step 2
Gently exhale and bend forward from your hips (""hip hinging""), keeping your knees extended (but not locked), and extend your arms in front of your body while slowly lowering your torso towards the floor until you can place your fingers or palms of your hands on the floor in front of your body.  Maintaining a flat spine and a soft bend in your knees during this movement is acceptable.

Step 3
Slowly begin to walk your hands forward (6-12” or 12 ½ - 25 cm steps) without moving your feet (your heels will begin to rise off the floor).  Continue walking yourself forward until you reach a full-push-up position where your spine, hips and head are level with the floor (plank position).

Step 4
Perform one full push-up, lowering your chest and hips simultaneously to the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase.  Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.   

Step 5
Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms fully extend at the elbows.  Slowly begin walking your feet forward towards your hands, taking 6-12” steps without moving your hands.  Maintain a flat spine throughout and continue walking until your feet are close to your hands.  

Step 6
Repeat this movement and continue for 10 – 15 yards (9-13 m).

Step 7
Exercise Variation:  You can progress this exercise by adding multiple push-ups in the lowered position.

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to monitor the position of your spine throughout the exercise.  Focus on keeping your spine flat and avoid any rounding of your low back.  Smaller steps help maintain correct body position.  Reaching too far forward with your arms will put unnecessary stress on the shoulders.

Starting Position: Stand holding dumbbells in front of you thighs using a closed, pronated grip (thumbs around the handles and palms facing your thighs). Position the dumbbells lightly touching the fronts of your thighs with your elbows extended or holding a slight bend. Assume either a split-stance position to stabilize your body or position your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart.
Step 2
Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal/core muscles (""bracing""), and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back), maintaining this position throughout the exercise. Your head position should be aligned with your spine.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells up in front of your body. Your elbows and upper arms should rise together and be slightly ahead of your forearms and dumbbells. As your arms move past 60 - 70 degrees (nearing shoulder level), slowly rotate them upwards somewhat so that the inside edge of the dumbbells point slightly upwards. Continue raising the dumbbells until your arms are level with your shoulders and approximately parallel with the floor. Maintain an erect torso (no arching of your low back) and neutral wrist position (avoid flexion and extension of your wrists).
Step 4
Downward Phase: Inhale and gently lower the dumbbells back towards your starting position keeping your elbows slightly extended. Maintain your foot, torso, shoulder and wrist positions while lowering the dumbbells and rotating them slightly inwards as your arms pass that 60-70 degree mark.
Traditionally, this exercise positions the arms into internal rotation during the lift, so the slight external rotation initiated at the 60-70 degree mark may reduce potential impingement in the shoulder joint.

Starting Position: Grasp two dumbbells and lie supine (on your back) on a flat bench with your feet firmly placed on the floor or upon a raised platform to allow you to maintain a flat or neutral (flat) spine. If working with a spotter, signal the spotter for assistance in handing you your the dumbbells.
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) to make firm contact with the bench. Your head, shoulders, butt and feet should make contact with the bench and floor/riser throughout the exercise. Signal your spotter for assistance in moving to your starting position. Grasp each dumbbell with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward, thumbs wrapped around the handle), press the dumbbells to a position level with or just below your eyes with the elbows fully extended. Maintain a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion/extension at the wrist joint).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in unison and in a controlled movement towards your mid-chest, but moving slightly wider towards the armpits. Gently touch the dumbbells to your chest without bouncing, maintaining your neutral wrist position. Keep the elbows close to your sides (emphasizes more triceps) or flared out from the body (emphasizes more pectorals). Maintain all points of contact with the bench and floor/riser and avoid any arching in the low back.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and gently press upwards to full elbow extension with the dumbbells positioned at or just below the level of your eyes. Maintain your points of contact with the bench and floor/riser, avoid arching your back during the lift and maintain neutral wrist position throughout the movement.
Step 5
At the end of the set, signal your spotter to assist you in taking the dumbbells and maintain a firm grip until the dumbbells are taken from your hands.
Safety is very important in this exercise. A spotter should adopt a split-stance position or half-kneeling position with the hands positioned as close to the most distal (wrist) joint. Keep the hands near, but not touching the wrists unless needed.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you.
 
Step 2
Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body from the knees without any bend at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"").
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
Push-ups place stress upon the wrist joints. To alleviate some of this stress you may opt to use dumbbells and grip the handles rather than place your hands on the floor. If your are pressing from an elevation such as a dumbbell, you do not need to lower your chest or chin to the floor, but rather lower yourself until your chest or chin are level with the dumbbell handles.

Starting Position: Place the end of a standard barbell in a corner so that it will not move unnecessarily, place a weight on one end of the barbell with a collar so that the weight can not fall off during the exercise.  Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, your toes pointed forward or slightly outward facing the end of the barbell so that it is between both feet and directly under your center of gravity.
 
Step 2
Squat down by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees, as you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward.  Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar). Position the end of the bar directly in front of your chest directly under your chin. Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward.
 
Step 3
Upward phase:  Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest.  Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position.
 
Step 4
As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
 
Step 5
As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension).
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise.
Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance. 


Technique is very important in this lift. Do not progress to explosive movements until you master your technique.
