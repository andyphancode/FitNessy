Starting Position: Holding the TRX handles in each hand, turn to face the anchor point. Position your feet together and hold the handles slightly above, or at shoulder-height, but at shoulder-width or slightly wider. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"").
Step 2
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly step to the left while keeping your weight over your heels, feet facing forward and using the TRX to help you maintain your balance. As you step, begin to raise both hands to an overhead position, preventing any excessive arching in your low back by depressing and retracting your scapulae (pulling your shoulders down and back) and contracting your abdominal muscles.
Step 3
Once your left foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight towards your left foot. Continue shifting your weight over the left foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your left knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your left foot. Your right leg should be near, or at full extension at the knee while keeping the right foot flat and your body weight should be shifted over to the left hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Your arms should be in a wide, overhead position.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and push off firmly with your left leg, while pulling on the TRX, returning your body to your starting position. Repeat the movement to the opposite side.
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it does necessitate additional attention to proper form.

Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on the floor / mat adjacent to a wall edge (corner) or in a door jam.  Elevate one leg to rest against the wall while the other leg will lie flat on the floor / mat past the wall edge or door jam.  Adjust your position to allow you to rest as much of the back of the elevated leg against the wall without having to lift your hips off the floor and point your toes towards the ceiling.  Extend your arms outwards at shoulder level with palms facing upwards and stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.

Step 2
Gently exhale and extend your leg slowly by contracting your quads while pulling your toes downwards towards your body, this will increase the stretch in your hamstrings and calf muscles.  Do not allow any movement in your hips and low back during this stretch. 

Step 3
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then change your position and repeat with the opposite leg. 
 
Step 4
Exercise Variation: Progress this by tilting your pelvis (hips) anteriorly (forward) to increase the stretch within the hamstrings.  While in the stretched position with your knee extended and toes pulled downwards, increase the arch in your lower back, which tilts your hips forward and increases the magnitude of the hamstrings stretch.
This stretch with pelvic tilts can be completed more dynamically by completing 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the tilted position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and perform the pelvic tilting movement slowly.

Starting Position: Stand 6 -12"" away from a wall with your feet hip-width apart and facing forward. Extend your arms to place your palms on the wall, level with your chest or shoulders.
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly lift your heels off the floor keeping your knees extended and without rotating your feet. Use your hands on the wall to support your body. Hold your raised position briefly.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower your heels back towards the floor.
Step 4
Exercise Variation (1): Single-leg Calf Raise: From your starting position, bend your left knee to lift your left foot off the floor and perform single-leg calf raises. Repeat with your right leg. 2. Internal and External Foot Position: Turn your feet inward (to the 10 and 2 o'clock positions on a clock) or turn your feet outward (to the same clock positions) as a starting position and perform your calf raises with both feet or with a single-leg. Turning your feet inward places more emphasis on the medial (inner) muscles while turning your feet outward places more emphasis on the lateral (outer) muscles
Step 5
Exercise Variation (2): Modified Internal and External Foot Position: Turn your feet inward (to 10 and 2 o'clock ) or turn your feet outward (to the same clock positions) and perform your calf raises with both feet or with a single leg. Turning your feet inward places more emphasis on the medial (inner) muscles while turning your feet outward places more emphasis on the lateral (outer) muscles.
The gastrocnemius (major calf muscle) contains a higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers thus is better suited to more explosive training. Therefore, once you have mastered your technique these raises can be performed more explosively (with greater power and force) so you can gain greater benefits from the exercise.

Starting Position:  Stand if front of a wall with feet placed a few inches apart and toes pointing toward the wall.  Lean forward, extending your arms and placing your hands on the wall to support your upper body.  Heels stay in contact with the floor.  Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back.

Step 2
Maintaining alignment, slowly lift your right foot off the floor, flexing (bending) the hip and bending the knee to 90 degrees.

Step 3
While stabilizing the body over your stance (left) leg and continuing to lean forward, swing your right leg across the front of the body in the transverse plane (rotating the hips).  Allow your chest to open to the left with your head staying in alignment moving the direction of the swing (gaze to the left).  Hold for 1-2 seconds. Then, swing the right leg out to the right side, rotating the hips in the transverse plane. Allow your chest to open to the right with your head in alignment.  Hold 1-2 seconds. Throughout the exercise, keep the heel of your stance leg in contact with the ground as your weight shifts.

Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) over the top of a properly-inflated stability ball (one that compresses approximately 6"" under your body weight) with both feet and hands on the floor, hip- and shoulder-width apart.
 
Step 2
Gently exhale, contract your abdominal/core muscles to stiffen your torso and slowly walk yourself forward, lifting your legs off the floor. Continue walking out until the fronts of your thighs or knees are resting on the top of the ball. Maintain a rigid torso aligned parallel with your legs. Retract and depress your scapulae (pull your shoulder back and down) as your reach your end position, with your arms fully extended and hands positioned directly under your shoulders. To help with stability, try to keep your legs straight and squeezed together. It helps to think about squeezing a quarter between your knees.
 
Step 3
Curling Phase: Exhale and slowly pull your knees towards your chest, rolling the ball forward as your knees tuck under your torso and your hips move upwards. Continue moving until your knees are positioned under your hips and your tibia (shinbone) lies over the top of the ball. Hold this position briefly.
 
Step 4
Lowering Phase: Inhale and push your knees away from your torso, returning your body to the starting position.
Avoid arching (sagging) your lower back or hiking your hips upwards in the starting position. Contract your abdominal, back and glute muscles to keep your torso and legs parallel to the floor.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip width apart, with the right foot slightly forward (the heel of the right foot should be parallel to the toes of the left foot), your body weight should be over the right foot, only the toes of the left foot should be touching the floor to help with balance and stabilization during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise. Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine, and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back and maintain this shoulder position throughout the exercise. 
 
Step 2
Downward Movement: Inhale and press the right foot into the ground so your weight is balanced between the ball, heel and outside edge of the foot (keep the toes of the left foot on the floor for support during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise).  Slowly begin to bend forward at the hips while maintaining the abdominal bracing to avoid shifting or rotation of your torso. Maintain a flat back and head alignment with your spine (or head extended slightly upwards). 
 
Step 3
Maintain a tall spine with the abdominals braced, push your weight back into your right hip while allowing the right knee to hinge, you can either hold your arms by your side (as pictured) or hold them out front as a counter-balance.  As you are lowering yourself, maintain your weight through the ball of the foot and heel of the stance (supporting) foot, keep the pelvis level and the hips aligned during the full range-of-motion of the exercise.   
Step 4
Upward Movement: keep your bodyweight in your right leg and foot, exhale and slowly push the right foot into the ground to start moving upwards (by extending your hip and knee) to return to the initial standing position, maintain the core bracing through the entire movement to help keep the hips level and control balance.
 
Step 5
Switch the stance (supporting) leg, and complete another set of repetitions on the other leg.
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: As this technique is mastered, the exercise intensity can be progressed by (1) lifting the supporting leg off of the floor. This increases the need for balance and stabilization within the body; (2) adding external resistance by holding a dumbbell in one hand or a medicine ball in both hands; (3) bending over and / or lower the hips closer to the ground increasing your knee bend; and (4) standing on unstable surfaces (e.g., Airex pad). 
 
Keep the stance foot flat on the floor during the entire range-of-motion of the movement; to emphasize the glutes, push your weight back into your hip during the lowering phase.

Step 2
Upward phase: Jump straight up into the air by explosively pushing your right foot in to the top of the box to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension) while simultaneously pushing off with your left foot and swinging both arms up and in front of your body to generate upward momentum.  As you jump into the air lift up your left leg in order to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. 
Step 3
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. 
Step 4
Landing phase: Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine. 
When jumping keep your spine straight and tall by contacting your abdominals (bracing) and be sure to perform the same number of repetitions on each leg.

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, then gently exhale and slowly bend forward from your hips, sliding your hands down your legs towards your ankles.  Attempt to maintain a flat back position and avoid rounding your back towards the ceiling (i.e., move from the hips and not your low back).  Keep your head aligned with your spine, knees extended and toes pointed upwards towards the ceiling. This should create a stretch through your calves and hamstrings, with some stretching in your low and middle back. 

Step 3
Continue to bend and reach forward to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds, then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times.  You may elect to grasp your ankles to hold this position.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bounding, and control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, avoid any excessive rounding of your low back.

Starting Position: Lay out your cones as illustrated creating a zig-zag line for 10 - 15 yards (9 - 14 m). The cones should be 2 - 4' (approximately 1 m) apart.
                              X                                      X
                    X                  X                   X                  X
          X                                     X                                       X
 
Step 2
Start by standing to the outside of the first cone, with both feet together or hip-width apart and feet facing forward.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and maintain this position throughout the exercise.

Step 3
Squat down, then immediately explode upwards in a diagnonal direction over the cone i na directio ntowards the 2nd cone (with a minimal pause in the squat position).  Your jump should push through your the heels of your feet and extend your hips, knees and ankles in one movement.  Swinging your arms upwards as you jump will increase your power and jumping ability. 

Step 4
Maintain your foot alignment during the jump, landing with your feet aligned in the same position as when you jumped.  Make first contact through your mid-foot (balls of your feet), rolling immediately back through you heels while initaiting a ""hip-hinge"" (bending at the hips, pushing your butt backwards) to absorb the impacting forces.  Continue to drop into a 1/2 squat position bofre transitioning explosively into another diagonal jump.
 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Progress the drill intensity by jumping higher over the cones, spacing the cones further apart (4 - 6') or increasing the overal length of the grid. However, one set through the drills should not exceed 10 seconds (if performing at a 9 or 10-out-of-10 effort) or 15-20 yards for lower intensities.
 

Always learn the proper machanics of landing before jumping. Alignment of the foot, knee and ankle, and the mechanics of landing are critical to minimizing injury associated with jumping activities.

Starting Position: Stand to the side of the hurdles so that they are lying to your left, your feet should be hip-width apart with the knees slightly bent.  Bend your hips and drop into an athletic ready position so that your knees are slightly bent and your chest is directly over your toes.  Your arms should be bent with the elbows fixed at approximately ninety degrees (during the drill ensure that the swinging is coming from the shoulder joint and not from the elbows).  Shift your bodyweight so that your weight is in your right leg.  Pick the left foot up so the left hip is at ninety degrees and prepare to place the left foot on the ground beween the first two hurdles while pushing the right foot in to the ground to move your body to your left.  Maintain an abdominal contraction and straight spine during this drill and keep your feet parallel so your toes are pointed straight ahead (in the same direction that you are facing).
 
Step 2
When your left foot hits the ground, shift your bodyweight into your left leg, pick up the right foot to the point where the right hip is approximately ninety degrees, lift the foot over the hurdle and bring it to the ground next to the left foot.
 
Step 3
Explosively push your right foot into the ground and pick up the left foot until the point where the left hip achieves approximately ninety degrees of flexion and continue running over the hurdles allowing both feet to touch the space in between each individual hurdle.
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: Once you have run over the hurdles moving to your right, change directions and run over the hurdles moving to your left.  Once you establish the rythym and pace of the movement, keep your head and eyes raised so that you are looking straight ahead where your opponent would be during an athletic competition.
Make sure to land softly as you step between the hurdles, land on the ball of the foot and roll down to the heel and keep your weight back in your hips and you run through the drill.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/120/lateral-cone-jumps/","Step 1
Starting Position: Place a series of cones 18-24"" apart in a straight line on a non-slip surface. Stand 3-6"" to your left of the first cone with your feet hip-width apart or closer, arms by your sides. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and position your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards through your lower extremity over the top of the first cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
 
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity over the second cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 8
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward, upward (towards an overhead position) and slightly sideways in your jumping direction during the jumping phases, (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases, (4) increasing the height of each cone or the spacing between each cone, or (5) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more cones and performing a greater number of jumps in each direction.
 
Learn first how to squat and perform regular squat jumps before attempting to jump laterally.

Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.  Extend your shoulders and reach your arms behind you to prepare the arm swing forward and upwards which will help with the upward momentum of the jump.
 
Step 2
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor as you explode your arms forward and throw them up in the air reaching overhead to help create upwards momentum away from the ground.
 
Step 3
Extend all the way through the body to create a straight line from your toes up through you arms and out of your hands.  When landing, land on the mid-foot rolling backwards towards the heels.  Push your hips backwards and downwards to absorb the impacting (ground) forces associated with landing.  Attempt to land softly and quietly and avoid locking out your knees on the landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
Exercise Variation: To increase the level of difficulty do a knee tuck and pull your knees up towards your chest as you are jumping into the air.
 
Before jumping become familiar with the movement mechanics by doing a few squats where you squat back into your heels and sink into your hips with your arms extended behind you, stand up from the squat while swinging your arms forward and roll up on your toes, then sink back into your heels; repeat for 4-6 repetitions.

As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet next to each other.
 
Step 4
While in the air traveling forward pull your legs in front of you while keeping your feet next to each other in order to prepare for the landing.  Your head should be level with your eyes looking to the spot on the floor where you want to land.
 
Step 5
Your legs should be in front of you with the feet parallel next to each other, bend the knees and flex the hips to prepare to absorb the impact forces of the landing.  Keep your eyes on the floor to prepare for the landing.
 
Step 6
Landing phase: Keep your feet parallel next to each other and attempt to land softly on the whole foot, let the balls of the feet hit the ground first and quickly roll down to your heels while sinking your weight back into your heels and hips.  Use the rapid bending of the hips and knees to absorb the impact forces of the landing, do not land with a straight or hyper-extended knee as this could create an injury.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: Perform multiple jumps in a row, minimize the amount of time on the ground, as soon as you land and absorb the forces in the legs and hips explode off the ground into the next jump.
Your body will follow your eyes so be sure to look to the spot on the floor where you want to land and keep your legs and hips soft, ready to absorb the impact forces upon landing.

Starting Position: Stand facing a row of hurdles (the hurdles should be spaced so they have an equal distance between each hurdle); start with the left leg forward and right leg back, right arm forward and left arm back (you can alternate this starting position, but be sure to have the opposite arm and leg forward); lean forward, hinging from the hips to prepare for the run.  Explosively push off with the left leg while rapidly lifting the right knee and swinging the left arm forward to generate the forward movement for the drill.
 
Step 2
Step over the first hurdle and plant the right foot in the space between the first and second hurdles while explosively driving the left knee up to create a ninety degree angle at the left hip, at the same time the left knee is rising up swing the right arm forward moving from the shoulder joint (the movement comes from the shoulder not the elbow).
 
Step 3
Lift the left foot over the next hurdle and plant it on the ground while explosively lifting the right knee to a height where it creates ninety degrees of hip flexion, at the same time the left arm should swing forward from the shoulder while the right arm swings back into extension.  Continue running over the hurdles by picking up the knees as high as you can to ensure that you are able to clear the hurdles as you run over them.
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation:  Start with one foot touch between each pair of hurdles and progress to being able to do two foot touches in between each pair of hurdles.
 
Maintain a tall posture with straight spine by engaging the abdominals (bracing) during the drill.

Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly lift yourself into a push-up position, shifting your hands until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles to prevent any arching in your low back or hiking of your hips towards the ceiling.
 
Step 2
Upward Phase: While maintaining a rigid torso and full extension in your arms and legs, slowly exhale and shift your weight backwards by pushing your hips backwards and upwards. Maintain your head alignment with your spine, but slowly move your head between your shoulders as your body moves backwards and attempt to push your heels towards the floor. Maintain the stiffness in your torso to prevent the tendency of your back to arch. Continue moving until your body forms an inverted-V, keeping both arms and legs extended and a neutral (flat) spine. Allow a slight bend in the knees if required to achieve the inverted-V position.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and return your body to the starting push-up position, maintaining the alignment of all your body segments.

Step 2
Jumping Movement: Quickly sink your weight back into your hips then explosively push both feet into the floor and driving your hips forward to accelerate your body into the air achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously) in both legs. As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
 
Step 3
While you are in the air cycle your legs by moving your left leg forward in front of your body, your right leg backwards behind your body; cycle your arms with your legs so that as your left leg comes forward your right arm comes forward and as your right leg moves back your left arm moves back.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: Be sure to alternate the forward leg, when learning this exercise focus first on landing with control and resetting before another repetition, as you improve your strength and power progress to performing multiple jumps in a row.
 

It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and land before attempting to jump. Once you have mastered the hip-hinge mechanism, begin with small jumps, but emphasize your landing mechanics. Only progress to more explosive jumps once you have mastered your landing mechanics.

Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull the shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe. 
 
Step 5
From the Lowered Position: the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position. 
 
Think about inhaling on the way down and exhaling while exerting on the way back to the initial standing position.

Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward.  Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar). Position the end of the bar directly in front of your chest directly under your chin. Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward.
 
Step 3
Upward phase:  Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest.  Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position.
 
Step 4
As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
 
Step 5
As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension).
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise.
Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance. 


Technique is very important in this lift. Do not progress to explosive movements until you master your technique.

Starting Position: Assume a seated position, extending one leg out in front. Secure a cable or resistance band around the ball of that foot. The resistance should be pulling the bottom of your foot away from you.
 
Step 2
Start with your foot in plantar flexion (toes pointed forward away from your body) and slowly dorsiflex the ankle (pulling your toes towards your shin). Slowly return to your starting position, controlling the speed of movement and repeat.
 
Step 3
The movement comes from your ankle, so avoid any bending or full extension of your knee throughout the movement. Always aim to keep your foot aligned facing forward.
 
Step 4
As an exercise progression, modify your movement to include a slight foot rotation as you dorsiflex the ankle (toes point towards the ceiling). The direction of your slight rotation should be into inversion (bringing the big toe towards your shin bone).
Attempt to sit upright and avoid any excessive arching or slouching in the low back.

Starting Position: Stand facing a raised platform or a plyometric jump box, place your right foot on the top of the step or box, keep your left foot on the ground, hinge from the hips to lean forward, keep your arms by your side with your right arm in shoulder extension behind you and your left arm in shoulder flexion in front of you, keep your head level with your eyes looking at a point on the ground two-to-three feet in front of you. 
Step 2
Upward phase: Jump straight up into the air by explosively pushing your right foot in to the top of the box to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension) while simultaneously pushing off with your left foot and swinging your right arm up and in front of your body to help generate upward momentum.  As you jump into the air lift up your left leg in order to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. 
Step 3
Mid-air: as you are in the air quickly swing your left leg forward and your right leg back so that you will land with your left foot on top of the platform and your right leg behind you on the floor. 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine. 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: When you are learning this exercise focus on the soft landing and reset your body in the correct position for the next jump and pause for a moment between jumps to ensure good form.  As you improve minimize the rest time so that you are rapidly moving from one jump to the next. 
 
When jumping keep your spine straight and tall by contacting your abdominals (bracing) and be sure to perform the same number of repetitions on each leg.

Starting Position: Stand directly in a square at one end of the ladder with your feet approximately hip-width apart.
 
Step 2
Bend your hips and drop into an athletic ready position so that your knees are slightly bent and your chest is directly over your toes.  Your arms should be bent with the elbows fixed at approximately ninety degrees (during the drill ensure that the swinging is coming from the shoulder joint and not from the elbows).
 
Step 3
Shift your bodyweight so that your weight is in your left leg.  Pick up the right foot and place it in the square next to the starting square while pushing the left foot in to the ground to move your body to your right and in to the next square of the ladder.
 
Step 4
Your right foot should hit the ground at the ball of the foot and roll all the way down to the heel, as the entire right foot hits the ground shift your body weight off of the left leg and place your weight on the right leg.  Once your bodyweight is on your right leg pick up your left foot to bring it into the same square as the right foot.  Keep your hips flexed and knees bent so that you maintain an athletic ready position throughout the length of the entire ladder.
 
Step 5
Continue to move down the ladder to your right; keep the bodyweight in the left leg while picking up the right foot to move it to the next square to the right; as the right foot hits the square, push off with the left foot and keep the bodyweight centered on top of the right leg.  Be sure to move both ways through the ladder; once you've done a certain number of repetitions to the right, be sure to switch directions and do the same number of repetitions moving to your left (pushing off of the right foot).  
 
Exercise Variation: As you improve your movement skills, dynamic balance and ability to move rapidly through the ladder, try not to look at your feet and keep your eyes on the horizon (where your opponents will be during an athletic competition).
