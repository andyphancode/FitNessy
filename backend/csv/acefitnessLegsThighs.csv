Starting Position:  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Inhale.

Step 2
Exhale and take a larger step forward with your right foot while raising your arms to the ceiling, palms facing each other. Keep your right foot pointed forward and turn your left foot out to the side 45 to 60 degrees. Align your left heel with your right.  Begin lunging forward into the right leg while keeping your back (left) leg extended.  Do not allow the right knee to extend past the right toes. Keep the back (left) heel in contact with the ground. Slowly drop your hips and rotate your torso to the right squaring your shoulders and hips to the front of the matt. Support your weight by pushing through your left foot and reach through your arms up lifting your ribcage away from the pelvis. 

Step 3
Hold this position for 3-5 slow, deep breaths (approximately 20-30 seconds) and repeat on the other side.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet about hip width apart. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.  Hold a medicine ball in front of your mid-section with a firm grip by both hands.
Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg. Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and keep the left (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (stance / supporting) foot. 
Step 3
As you lunge forward, focus more on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your left knee towards the heel of your right foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your left while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section. 
Step 4
From the lowered position, rotate back to the right so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the right foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the right knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously.  As you are pulling yourself foward with the right leg, pick the left leg off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Step 5
While balancing on the right leg, step forward with the left foot off the floor, stabilize your body by maintaining the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body.  Keep the right (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the left (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the left leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the  right (stance / supporting) foot. 
 
Step 6
As you continue into the next lunge with the left foot forward, keep the focus on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your right (back) knee towards the heel of your left (front) foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your left (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your right while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section. 
Step 7
From the lowered position, rotate back to the left so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the left foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the left knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously.  As you are pulling yourself foward with the left leg, pick the right foot off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Step 8
Continue the walking lunge with rotation for a specific number of repetitions or a certain distance.
 
Step 9
One variation is to contract the abdominals and glutes at the top of the stance phase (for example while balanced on the right leg with the left leg off of the ground) for 2-3 seconds to create a balance challenge.  Another variation is to add more resistance by holding one dumbbell in each hand with the elbows bent at 90 degrees and pressed into the sides of the abdominals.
To control the rotation of the movement, maintain a tall, straight spine and turn your head with your shoulders.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/93/trx-reg-suspended-lunge/","Step 1
Starting Position: Stand in front of the anchor point and interlock the two TRX handles together (refer to TRX user instructions). Loop the foot cradle around the ball of your right foot while supporting yourself. Slowly turn to face away from the anchor point, standing on your stance leg, aligned in front, but directly in line with the anchor point. Your suspended foot should be dorsiflexed at the ankle (toes pulled towards your shin).
Step 2
Adopt a modified sprinter-stance with the right leg flexed to 90 degrees, knees aligned side by side, and the left arm flexed to 90 degrees at the elbow with the finger tips level with or just below your chin. Your right arm should also be flexed to 90 degrees, driving it back from the shoulder until the upper arm lies approximately 45 degrees from vertical.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower your body towards the floor, shifting the hips backwards simultaneously and maintaining your body weight over the heel of your left foot. As your body lowers, the suspended leg will drive backwards, maintaining the 90 degree bend at the knee. Your right arm should drive forward from the shoulder towards the a end-position where the left arm started. Your left arm should simultaneously drive backwards to an end-position where the right arm started. Throughout the arm movements, squeeze the arms to the sides of your body and drive from the shoulders while maintaining the 90 degree bends. Continue to lower yourself maintaining weight over your left heel until your right thigh and torso are in parallel (form a straight line together). Your left tibia (shinbone) should move level with or slightly ahead of the ball of your left foot.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press your body upwards by pushing down against the floor through your left heel. The muscle action at the knee and hips extend the body back to your starting position.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): To increase the exercise intensity move more explosively to triple extension. The upward phase should be performed more explosively and incorporating triple extension (at the ankle, knee and hip).
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2): To increase the exercise intensity move the upper extremity into different planes. While the lower extremity moves in the sagittal plane (front and back), the upper extremity and/or arms can move in the frontal (left and right) and transverse plane (rotation).
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it does necessitate additional attention to proper form.

Starting Position: Place your feet securely in the foot cradles positioned directly under the TRX anchor point. Apply downward pressure with your heels by dorsiflexing your ankles (toes point towards your shins) Gently lie back on a mat / floor with your arms at your sides and palms flat on the ground. Contract your core and glute muscles to lift your hips off the mat / floor keeping your body aligned and rigid, using your hands to help stabilize your body. Slowly contract your hamstrings to move your heels towards your hips while keeping your ankles in dorsiflexion. The hips should move into flexion (bending in the hips), but your torso should remain rigid with your weight bearing on your shoulders. Keep you feet together throughout the exercise.
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and press your hips towards the ceiling, extending your hips into a rigid straight line, but avoid arching your lower back. Avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly return your hips to your starting position. Avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 4
Progression: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by lengthening the straps and positioning your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX.
During this exercise, individuals often arch their back to press the hips as high as possible. This increases the stresses on the low back and should be avoided. Contracting your abdominal muscles and maintaining a neutral (flat) spine can reduce these stresses.

Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on the floor / mat adjacent to a wall edge (corner) or in a door jam.  Elevate one leg to rest against the wall while the other leg will lie flat on the floor / mat past the wall edge or door jam.  Adjust your position to allow you to rest as much of the back of the elevated leg against the wall without having to lift your hips off the floor and point your toes towards the ceiling.  Extend your arms outwards at shoulder level with palms facing upwards and stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.

Step 2
Gently exhale and extend your leg slowly by contracting your quads while pulling your toes downwards towards your body, this will increase the stretch in your hamstrings and calf muscles.  Do not allow any movement in your hips and low back during this stretch. 

Step 3
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then change your position and repeat with the opposite leg. 
 
Step 4
Exercise Variation: Progress this by tilting your pelvis (hips) anteriorly (forward) to increase the stretch within the hamstrings.  While in the stretched position with your knee extended and toes pulled downwards, increase the arch in your lower back, which tilts your hips forward and increases the magnitude of the hamstrings stretch.
This stretch with pelvic tilts can be completed more dynamically by completing 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the tilted position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and perform the pelvic tilting movement slowly.

This exercise is a dynamic movement exercise used to prepare the body for activity. As it involves a series of squatting movements, it is highly recommended you master your squatting technique before attempting this exercise.
Step 2
Starting Position: Stand with your feet wider than hip-width (24-36"") with your arms by your sides. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
Step 3
Movement: Drop into a wide-stance squat position (mechanics are similar to regular squat), lowering your body to a comfortable depth or until your thighs lie parallel to the floor and your body weight rests on your heels. Feel free to position your arms where they assist you in maintaining balance.
Step 4
Push upwards through the balls of your feet and into triple extension (extending the ankle, knee and hip joints) simultaneously rotating your body forward and pivoting 180-degrees your inside foot. Lift your outer leg off the ground and rotate it around to place it 24-36"" away from your pivoting foot.
Step 5
Upon placing your outer leg, firmly on the floor, drop once again into a wide-stance squat position (mechanics are similar to regular squat), lowering your body to a comfortable depth or until your thighs lie parallel to the floor and your body weight rests on your heels.
Step 6
Repeat this movement in one direction or stopping to turn back towards your starting position.
Step 7
Exercise Variation: The dynamic balance challenge to the body can be increased in this exercise by: (1) Pivoting faster without losing postural control (balance) or (2) pivoting with a backward rotation off the other foot rather than pivoting in a forward rotation.
To enjoy the benefits of this exercise, focus upon the quality of this movement. Control your movement tempo (pace) and never lose your postural control (balance).

Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly load the weight of your body into your leading (right) foot, step backwards to place the trailing (left) foot on the floor in its starting position. Allow your body to lean slightly forward during the step-down movement. Load your weight into your trailing (left) foot and step off the platform with your leading (right) foot, returning to your starting position. Repeat for the opposite side.
 
Step 4
An exercise progression is to step-up onto one leg only and remain standing on a single-leg before stepping back down.
Single-leg stepping is a functional movement we perform daily. Always monitor your foot, ankle and knee position. Avoid movement of your foot and ankle (collapsing in or out), and always attempt to keep your knee aligned over your second toe.

Starting Position:  Stand with your feet in straddle position (wider than hip-width apart) with your left foot pointing forward and your right foot pointed to the side and arms by your sides.  Line up the heel of your left foot, with your right heel.  Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and tilt your head slightly up.

Step 2
Reach your left arm straight into the air, keeping it close to your head and palm tuned in (pinky in front, thumb in back).  Keep your shoulders down, letting only the arm lift. Place your right hand lightly on your right leg. 
 
Step 3
Slowly drop your right shoulder letting your right hand move closer to your right foot.  Continue reaching up and over with your left arm as you move into lateral flexion (bending to the side). Maintain abdominal bracing and keep your head in line with your spine.  Your weight should be distributed evenly through both legs.  Maintain an open chest, keeping your right arm in line with your ear. 
 
Step 4
Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds for a total of 2-4 repetitions.  Move into the stretch a littler deeper with each repetition.  Repeat on the opposite side.
 

When sliding your hand down your leg, make sure you do not allow your hand to rest directly on your knee.  Place it above or below depending on your flexibility.  Your hand should rest lightly on the leg, not support your body weight.  Do not compromise form in order to reach your hand closer to the ground.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet approximately hip width apart. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
In preparation to step forward, slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The raised (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot.
 
Step 3
As you lower yourself forward into the lunge position, maintain the abdominal bracing and focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While in the lunge position simultaneously bend forward at your hips, while maintaining a flat back and contracting (squeezing) the glutes of the left (backward) leg, this will help increase the stretch in the left hip flexor muscles.
 
Step 4
Hold this stretch position for 15-30 seconds at a time for a total of 2-4 repetitions; try to move into the stretch a little deeper with each repetition, but be sure to keep your body in alignment.  Complete all repetitions on one side before alternating to the other leg.  Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position. 
 
At the bottom of the movement: contracting your abdominals and the glutes of the rear leg  while simultaneously lifting your chest up to the ceiling back will help increase the stretch to the back leg.

Starting Position: Attach a cuff (cable or band resistance) to one ankle with the anchor or resistance point behind your body. Stand with feet hip-width apart. In this position, the band / resistance cable should be under little, to no tension. Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. 


Step 2
Slowly lift your cuffed foot 1 - 2"" off the floor while stabilizing your body on your stance (supporting leg) without shifting your hips or leaning with your torso. Hold on to a stable surface for balance as needed. 


Step 3
Slowly lift your cuffed foot 1 - 2"" off the floor while stabilizing your body on your stance (supporting leg) without shifting your hips or leaning with your torso. Hold on to a stable surface for balance as needed. 


Step 4
Continue extending your knee until your leg is straightened or you reach the limits of your comfort level. The point where you notice your hips or torso beginning to tilt backwards indicates that you have reached the limits of movement in your joint. 


Step 5
Downward Movement: Inhale and slowly return your leg back to your starting position without losing your balance or changing the position of your torso or stance (supporting) leg. 


Step 6
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be enhanced by (1) increasing your range of motion if you were unable to straighten your knee, (2) increasing the resistance in the cable / band, or (3) removing any balance assistance, or standing on an unstable surface (e.g., Airex pad, BOSU, etc.). 


The ability to perform this exercise unassisted offers the added benefit of balance training.

Starting Position: Place a stability ball against a wall and gently lean against it, positioning the top of the ball into the small of your back, but making contact with your tailbone, low- and mid-back. Your feet should be positioned 6 - 12"" out in front of your body, feet hip-width apart and facing forward or turned out slightly.
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back and gently lean into the ball, while loading your weight through your heels. Place your hands on the front of your thighs.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower your body, rolling the ball down the wall simultaneously, but keeping contact with your tailbone, low and mid-back against the ball. Focus on dropping your hips under the ball and pushing your hips back to reduce potential stresses placed across your knees. Avoid any movement of your feet and keep your knees aligned over your 2nd toe. Continue to lower yourself until challenged or until your thighs align parallel to the floor and hold this position briefly.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly push your body up away from the floor, focusing on extending your hips to bring them back underneath your body. Continue pushing upwards until your hips and knees are fully extended.
To help develop the foundations of good squatting form, emphasize dropping your hips down and slightly under the ball, and avoiding driving your knees down and forward.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on a mat, placing the backs of your lower legs and heels on the top of a stability ball. Position your feet hip-width apart on the ball with your ankles slightly dorsiflexed (toes pointing towards the ceiling). Gently contract your abdominal/core muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this gentle muscle contraction throughout the exercise. Extend your arms out to your sides with palms turned to the floor to help stabilize your body during the exercise.
Step 2
Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and press your hips upwards off the floor into extension by contracting your glutes (butt muscles). At the same time press the backs of your lower legs and heels into the ball for additional stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back. Continue to press upwards until your legs and hips are straight with your torso and legs in alignment.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly contract your hamstrings to move your heels towards your hips while plantar flexing (toes pointed away from your shines) your ankles to rest the soles of your feet on top of the ball. Continue to pull your heels towards hips, raising your hips further off the floor. Maintain a stable torso, keeping it parallel with your upper thighs.
Step 4
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): To increase the balance challenge, move your feet closer together on the stability ball.
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2): To increase the balance challenge, move your arms towards your side or place them on your chest to reduce your stabilizing points of contact with the floor.
Step 7
Exercise Variation (3): To increase the balance challenge, raise one leg off the ball in the starting position and curl with one leg.
Avoid arching your lower back as your press your hips upward to the starting position. This can be achieved by contracting your abdominal muscles prior to lifting and keeping them engaged throughout the lift.

Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
Step 7
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can increase the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) Driving your arms behind you during the downward phase (illustrated), (2) driving your arms forward and upward during the jumping phase (illustrated), or (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phase.
It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and land before attempting to jump. Once you have mastered the hip-hinge mechanism, begin with small jumps, but emphasize your landing mechanics. Only progress to more explosive jumps once you have mastered your landing mechanics.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip width apart, with the right foot slightly forward (the heel of the right foot should be parallel to the toes of the left foot), your body weight should be over the right foot, only the toes of the left foot should be touching the floor to help with balance and stabilization during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise. Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine, and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back and maintain this shoulder position throughout the exercise. 
 
Step 2
Downward Movement: Inhale and press the right foot into the ground so your weight is balanced between the ball, heel and outside edge of the foot (keep the toes of the left foot on the floor for support during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise).  Slowly begin to bend forward at the hips while maintaining the abdominal bracing to avoid shifting or rotation of your torso. Maintain a flat back and head alignment with your spine (or head extended slightly upwards). 
 
Step 3
Maintain a tall spine with the abdominals braced, push your weight back into your right hip while allowing the right knee to hinge, you can either hold your arms by your side (as pictured) or hold them out front as a counter-balance.  As you are lowering yourself, maintain your weight through the ball of the foot and heel of the stance (supporting) foot, keep the pelvis level and the hips aligned during the full range-of-motion of the exercise.   
Step 4
Upward Movement: keep your bodyweight in your right leg and foot, exhale and slowly push the right foot into the ground to start moving upwards (by extending your hip and knee) to return to the initial standing position, maintain the core bracing through the entire movement to help keep the hips level and control balance.
 
Step 5
Switch the stance (supporting) leg, and complete another set of repetitions on the other leg.
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: As this technique is mastered, the exercise intensity can be progressed by (1) lifting the supporting leg off of the floor. This increases the need for balance and stabilization within the body; (2) adding external resistance by holding a dumbbell in one hand or a medicine ball in both hands; (3) bending over and / or lower the hips closer to the ground increasing your knee bend; and (4) standing on unstable surfaces (e.g., Airex pad). 
 
Keep the stance foot flat on the floor during the entire range-of-motion of the movement; to emphasize the glutes, push your weight back into your hip during the lowering phase.

Starting Position: Stand facing a raised platform or a plyometric jump box, place your right foot on the top of the step or box, keep your left foot on the ground, hinge from the hips to lean forward, keep your arms by your side and your head level with your eyes looking at a point on the ground two-to-three feet in front of you.
Step 2
Upward phase: Jump straight up into the air by explosively pushing your right foot in to the top of the box to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension) while simultaneously pushing off with your left foot and swinging both arms up and in front of your body to generate upward momentum.  As you jump into the air lift up your left leg in order to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. 
Step 3
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. 
Step 4
Landing phase: Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine. 
When jumping keep your spine straight and tall by contacting your abdominals (bracing) and be sure to perform the same number of repetitions on each leg.

Starting Position: Lie on your right side on a mat/floor with your legs extended straight away from your body. Bend your left knee and pull your left heel up towards your left glute muscle (buttock), use your left hand to grab a hold of the top of your left foo.  Your right (lower) arm should be bent and positioned under your head for support. Your hips and shoulder should be aligned vertically to the floor. Your head should be aligned with your spine.

Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"") to position your spine in neutral position and maintain stability through your pelvis, maintain this abdominal contraction throughout the stretch.  Exhale and use your left hand to gently pull your left heel and lower leg towards your tailbone while simultaneously keeping the left thigh and knee resting on the inside of the right thigh and pointing straight out from the left hip joint.  Hold this position for 30-45 seconds, then straighten the leg and contract (squeeze) the quadriceps (thigh) muscles and repeat for 2-5 repetitions; alternate sides and repeat with the right leg. 

Step 3
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the stretch point your left knee behind your body while continuing to hold on to your left foot.  Another option is to hold the stretch for 10-15 seconds, push your left foot into your hand (like trying to straighten your leg), hold for 5-7 seconds, then relax and pull your heel closer to your tailbone, repeat for 3-5 repetitions and alternate sides.
 

Be sure to keep the spine in a straight line and maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the pelvis stable.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat/floor with your legs extended, feet together in neutral position pointing away from your body (at 90 degrees to your shinbone). Keep your lower arm bent and positioned under your head for support while the upper arm rests upon your upper hip. Your hips and shoulder should be aligned vertically to the floor. Your head should be aligned with your spine. Slowly flex (move forward) your lower leg until it lies in front of your upper leg. Rest both feet on the floor and keep both legs extended with feet in neutral position.
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and gently raise the lower leg off the floor while keeping the knee extended and the foot in a neutral position. The hips should remain vertical to the floor (knee of the raised leg should not rotate upward towards the ceiling or downward towards the floor). Continue raising the leg until your hips begin to tilt sideways or until your feel tension develop in your low back or oblique muscles.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Gently inhale and slowly return the raised leg to your starting position in a controlled manner. After completing your set, roll over and repeat with the opposite leg.
Due to the limited movement at the hip joint in this direction, the leg need only rise a few inches off the mat/floor.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet parallel facing forward and hip-width apart. Position your hands where comfortable to help you maintain your balance during the exercise. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing""). Keep your head facing slightly upwards and shift your weight onto your heels.
Step 2
Inhale and gently unload your right leg, slowly stepping to the right while keeping your weight over your heels and both feet facing forward. Once your right foot is firmly placed on the floor, bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight towards the right foot. Continue shifting your weight over the right foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your right knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your right foot. Your left leg should be near, or at full extension at the knee and your body weight should still be distributed into the right hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Keep your left foot flat on the floor as you allow your weight to shift into your right hip and alternate. Feel free to position your arms where necessary to help maintain your balance, reaching for your right foot with your left hand will emphasize hip flexion (alternate with the right hand reaching for the left foot).
Step 3
Exhale and push off firmly with your right leg, returning your body to your starting position. Repeat the movement for the opposite side.
A common mistake when performing a side lunge is that individuals often step too wide and are unable to align the tibia (shinbone) over the placed foot and the knee falls inside the foot. In this case, simply shorten the width of the step taken to allow you to align the tibia over the placed foot.

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, then gently exhale and slowly bend forward from your hips, sliding your hands down your legs towards your ankles.  Attempt to maintain a flat back position and avoid rounding your back towards the ceiling (i.e., move from the hips and not your low back).  Keep your head aligned with your spine, knees extended and toes pointed upwards towards the ceiling. This should create a stretch through your calves and hamstrings, with some stretching in your low and middle back.

Continue to bend and reach forward to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds, then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times.  You may elect to grasp your ankles to hold this position.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bounding, and control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, avoid any excessive rounding of your low back.

STARTING POSITION: Sit in the machine, positioning your back and sacrum (tailbone) flat against the machine's backrest. Place your feet on the resistance plate, toes pointing forward and adjust your seat and foot position so that the bend in your knees is at approximately 90 degrees with your heels flat. Lightly grasp any available handles to stabilize your upper extremity.  Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, be careful to avoid movement in your low back throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Slowly exhale while pushing the resistance plate away from your body by contracting your glutes, quadiceps and hamstrings. Keep your heels flat against the resistance plate and avoid any movement in the upper extremity.

Step 3
Continue extending your hips and knees until the knees reach a relaxed, extended position, with the heels still pressed firmly into the plate.  Do not hyperextend (lock-out) your knees and avoid lifting your butt off the seat pad or rounding out your low back.

Step 4
Pause momentarily, then slowly return to your starting position by flexing (bending) the hips and knees, and allowing the resistance plate to move towards you in a slow, controlled manner.  Do not allow your upper thighs to compress your ribcage. Repeat the movement.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: Single-leg press.
Repeat the same exercise, but use each leg independently  
 

Improper technique can lead to injury. Control the extension phase by keeping your heels in contact with the plate and avoid locking out your knees. During the return phase, control the movement and avoid compressing your upper thighs against your ribcage.

Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) on a mat and attach a cuff (cable or band resistance) to one ankle with the anchor or resistance point away from your body. Lie with feet hip-width apart. Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine. Keep your ankle lightly dorsi-flexed (toes pointed towards your shinbone) throughout the exercise.  



Step 2
Curling Movement: Exhale and curl (bend) your knee, bringing your heel towards your buttock without moving your thigh (the top of your thigh remains on the mat), lifting your hips off the mat or arching your low back. 



Step 3
Continue bending your knee until your heels near, or touch your buttock, or you reach the limits of your comfort level. The point where you notice your hips or low-back beginning to move indicates that you have reached the limits of movement in your joint.  



Step 4
Downward Movement: Inhale and slowly return your leg back to your starting position.



Step 5
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by (1) increasing your range of motion by moving your heel closer to your buttock or (2) increasing the resistance in the cable / band.




There is often a tendency to hike the hips upwards or extend the low back (increasing the low back arch) during this exercise. By engaging (lightly contracting) your abdominal muscles, this will help prevent hip hiking and low back hyper-extension.

Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) on an exercise mat or floor with your elbows close to your sides and directly under your shoulders, palms down and hands facing forward. Contract your quadriceps to extend your legs and dorsiflex your ankles (pull toes towards your shins). Contract your core and abdominal muscles to stiffen your torso. Slowly lift your entire torso off the floor or mat, maintaining a stiff torso and legs. Avoid any arching (sagging) in your low back, hiking (upwards) in your hips or bending in the knees. Avoid shrugging your shoulder and keep your shoulders positioned directly over your elbows rotating your forearms so your palms are facing each other.

Step 2
Hinge at the hips, drop your right knee to the ground so your knee, shin, and foot are on the ground. Drag your knee forward toward the center of your arms, angling your right shin and foot across your body to the left side.

Step 3
Begin extending your back (left) leg, plantar flexing the foot so your toes are pointing away from your body.  Sink your pelvis into the ground. As your right glute moves toward the ground do not shift your weight in to the right hip.  Concentrate on shifting the left hip forward in order to keep the pelvis level.  Only extend to the point where your pelvis remains level and weight centered. Lower your chest to your top (right) leg keeping your arms in starting position extending out of the hip.  Hold this position for 15-30 seconds for a total of 2-4 repetitions on each side.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/265/partner-assisted-bodyweight-squats/","Step 1
Starting Position: Two training partners should stand approximately arm's length away from one another with their feet slightly wider than hip width apart with your toes pointed forward or slightly outward.  Position your feet so that the balls of your feet align under your center of gravity. Each partner should outstretch his or her arms so they can grasp each other's forearms with their hands.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Each partner should start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight.  Each partner should maintain a firm grip and allow each other to lean back slightly in order to be able to sink deeper into the hips for a greater range-of-motion.
Step 3
Each person should continue to lower themself until their thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until their heels begin to lift off the floor, or until their torso begins to round or flex forward. Each person should monitor his or her feet, ankles and knees, to maintain control of their feet and knees each person should think about pushing the floor away from them while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as they return to a standing position. 
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe, and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: While keeping a firm grip on one another's forearms, each person should maintain a straight trunk with a head-up position, and exhale while extending the hips and knees by pushing their feet into the floor through the heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Each person should continue extending his or her hips until returning to the starting position. 
 
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Each partner can place his or her feet in a split-squat position with the feet hip width apart and one foot slightly in front of the other.  Each partner can balance on a single leg and perform a single leg squat, the act of the partners holding on to one another during the squatting movement will help to maintain the balance on one leg.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia (shinbone) forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent the excess arching in the back with this correction. If using a squat rack, the safety rungs on the rack should be positioned at mid-thigh level.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and holding a medicine ball in both hands directly in front of your chest; grasp the ball with your hands in a neutral position (palms facing each other), and elbows fully flexed (bent) and facing down towards the floor. 
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) and engage your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and support your spine. Maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and reach the medicine ball back between your legs to prepare to bring it up overhead in a rapid motion.  
 
Step 3
Upward phase: Swing the medicine ball upwards over your head while reaching it back behind your head and neck and simultaneously straightening your legs and rolling up on the balls of your toes to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension); lean back while pushing the hips forward to lengthen the abdominal muscles, keep the abdominals contracted and engaged (bracing) throughout the movement to ensure spinal stability.  
Step 4
Explosively bring the ball down over your head to throw it directly downwards into the floor while dropping your weight back into your hips.  As you throw the ball down, make sure you are maintaining the abdominal bracing and hinge from the hips to maintain spinal stability.
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Use a bouncing medicine ball to throw it straight down and have the ball bounce back up into your hands to perform continuous repetitions. 
If using a bouncing medicine ball make sure that you have ample space for safety; if you are using a non-bouncing medicine ball (a ""dead"" ball) make sure you are on a solid, stable floor that can support the force of the weight being thrown explosively into the floor.

Starting Position: Assume a seated position with legs extended in front of you and point your toes towards the ceiling without bending your knees.  Gently fold your left leg by bending the knee and tucking the sole of that foot gently against the inside of your right thigh.  Sit upright (i.e., trunk vertical) with your head aligned with your spine and place your hands on the top of your thighs.
 
Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, then gently exhale and slowly bend forward from your hips, sliding your hands down your legs towards your ankles.  Attempt to maintain a flat back position and avoid rounding your back towards the ceiling (i.e., move from the hips and not your low back).  Keep your head aligned with your spine, knees extended and toes pointed upwards towards the ceiling. This should create a stretch through your hamstrings and calf muscles, with some stretching in your low and middle back.
 
Step 3
Continue to bend and reach forward to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds, then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times.  You may elect to grasp your ankles to hold this position.  Repeat with the opposite leg
 
Step 4
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bounding, and control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, avoid any excessive rounding of your low back.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet together. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Hold a light-to-moderate weight medicine ball in front of your chest with both hands firmly holding on to the ball. 

Step 2
Step forward slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg.  Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and press the left (stance / supporting) foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (forward) leg with the foot placed firmly on the floor, think about lowering yourself into your hips by allowing your weight to shift downwards towards the floor instead of forward. As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (supporting) foot. While simultaneously lowering yourself into your right leg and hip, lift your hands holding the medicine ball straight overhead while continuing to maintain the abdominal bracing.

Step 3
While in the bottom (downward) phase of the lunge, pull the medicine ball back down towards your chest, continue to maintain a stiff core and drive your right foot into the ground to extend the right knee and straighten the leg to return to the original (starting) position of standing with both feet under the hips and the ball held in front of the chest.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time. 

Step 4
Exercise Variation: Begin with a light-weight medicine ball in order to learn how to maintain stability all of the way through the movement.  To increase the level of difficulty and to improve core and shoulder strength, once you can perform 8-12 repetitions on each leg, increase the weight of the medicine ball.  Another option is to hold one dumbbell in each hand, start with the elbows bent at ninety degrees and tucked in to the side, at the bottom of the lunge, bend the elbows to bring the weight up to the shoulders and press it directly overhead.

Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilize your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg and avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body by maintaining the abdominal bracing.  Keep the left (stance/supporting) foot pressed firmly into the ground, hold this position momentarily before stepping forward with the right foot. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading/forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower yourself into the right leg, maintain a straight spine by leaning forward from the hips and lower your right elbow on the inside of your right knee. 
 
Step 3
As you lower yourself into the lunge, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Place both hands on the floor with the right slightly forward of the left and continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean.  While in the lowered position with both hands on the floor, push back through the left foot to extend the left hip and maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the pelvis stable and increase the stretch to the left hip flexor.

Step 4
From the lowered position, keep your abdominals braced and push your hands into the floor to begin to raise yourself back to a standing position.  Press the right (forward) foot into the ground and drive the right knee backwards to create knee and hip extension and pull yourself forward into a standing position.  Keep your chest lifted and abdominals braced to maintain a straight spine and level pelvis while beginning to swing the left leg forward to initiate the next repetition and stretch in to the right hip.  
 
Step 5
Continue the exercise for a specific number of repetitions or over a certain distance of travel.

Step 6
Exercise Variation: to add a stretch for the hamstrings before stepping in to the next lunge, push off of the floor with your hands, lean back and push the right foot in to the ground to straighten the right leg while shifting your weight into your left hip and stretch the right hamstrings.  Alternate with both legs.
 
Focus on maintaining the abdominal bracing through the entire range-of-motion of the movement to keep the spine stable and pelvis level.

Step 2
Start by standing to the outside of the first cone, with both feet together or hip-width apart and feet facing forward.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and maintain this position throughout the exercise.

Step 3
Squat down, then immediately explode upwards in a diagnonal direction over the cone i na directio ntowards the 2nd cone (with a minimal pause in the squat position).  Your jump should push through your the heels of your feet and extend your hips, knees and ankles in one movement.  Swinging your arms upwards as you jump will increase your power and jumping ability. 

Step 4
Maintain your foot alignment during the jump, landing with your feet aligned in the same position as when you jumped.  Make first contact through your mid-foot (balls of your feet), rolling immediately back through you heels while initaiting a ""hip-hinge"" (bending at the hips, pushing your butt backwards) to absorb the impacting forces.  Continue to drop into a 1/2 squat position bofre transitioning explosively into another diagonal jump.
 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Progress the drill intensity by jumping higher over the cones, spacing the cones further apart (4 - 6') or increasing the overal length of the grid. However, one set through the drills should not exceed 10 seconds (if performing at a 9 or 10-out-of-10 effort) or 15-20 yards for lower intensities.
 

Always learn the proper machanics of landing before jumping. Alignment of the foot, knee and ankle, and the mechanics of landing are critical to minimizing injury associated with jumping activities.

Starting Position: Set out cones approximately 5 yards apart, stand at the far left cone in an athletic ready position: feet hip-width apart, knees bent with your weight back in your flexed hips.  Engage the abdominals (bracing) to maintain spinal stability throughout the exercise.
 
Step 2
Maintain the athletic ready position with your hips bent, your chest over your knees and your nose over your toes with your weight balanced between being up on the balls of your feet and back in your hips; shift your weight towards your right and pick up your right foot while explosively pushing your left foot into the ground to start moving to your right.
 
Step 3
Maintain the athletic ready position while continuing to move to your right, picking up the right foot and placing it to the right while pushing the left foot into the ground to generate the force and momentum for the sideways movement.  Your feet should remain parallel with one another with the toes facing foward and your weight on the balls of your feet (keep the whole foot on the ground, but your weight should be forward over the front of your feet); the emphasis of this drill should be on rapid, quick foot actions for the sideways (lateral) shuffling.
 
Step 4
At the far cone maintain the athletic ready position while shifting your weight over your left leg and push off with the right foot to begin shuffling back to the original starting point.  As you shuffle back to your left, pick up the left foot and place it to the left while pushing offer with the right foot.  Ensure that your feet remain parallel with your toes pointing forward and focus on rapid, quick foot actions for the duration of the movement.
 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Work with a coach or training partner to provide either visual cues: by signaling which direction to move with a hand gesture, e.g. pointing to the left to shuffle to the left; or verbal cues: by stating which direction to shuffle, e.g. stating ""right"" to shuffle to the right. 
Maintain a wide base of support, as you shuffle your feet should remain at least hip-width apart to maintain dynamic balance as you move over the ground.

Starting Position:  Using two stacks of risers; height not exceeding the top of your gastrocnemius (calf) muscle, place a body bar/broomstick across the top, leaving enough room between the stacks for you to step over it laterally.  Make a total of 2-4 stations, lining them up with enough room for you to do a side lunge between them.  Stand directly next to the broomstick, so it is perpendicular to your right leg.  Your feet should be hip- width apart, toes pointing forward or turned slightly outwards, with arms by your sides and elbows flexed (bent) to 90 degrees. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, and shift your weight over your heels
 
Step 2
Shift your bodyweight into your left leg and lift your right foot off of the ground and bend at the hips, pushing them backwards, while simultaneously shifting your weight to your left leg.  Maintain abdominal “bracing” and alignment. Continue loading your weight into the LEFT leg while lifting the right foot off the ground and bringing your right leg over the broomstick to hip flexion with your knee at a 90 degree angle in alignment with your hips. Your right foot should remain in dorsi-flexion (toes pulled up towards your shin) with the toes pointing forward. Place the right foot down on the opposite side of the broomstick (dowel rod) and shift your weight into your right hip to prepare to bring your left foot over the obstacle to place it next to the right. Level your hips and secure your balance.
 
Step 3
Place your right foot on the ground and bend at the hips, pushing them backwards, while simultaneously shifting your weight to your right leg.  Maintain abdominal “bracing” and alignment. Continue loading your weight into the RIGHT leg while lifting the left foot off the ground and bringing your left leg over the broomstick to hip flexion with your knee at a 90 degree angle in alignment with your hips. Your left foot should remain in dorsi-flexion (the toes pulled up towards the shin) with the toes pointing forward. Level your hips and secure your balance. Place your left foot on the ground, ending in the same body position as you started.
 
Step 4
“Unders” Continue the exercise stepping your right foot to the side, while keeping your weight over your heels and both feet facing forward step your right leg to the side. Once your right foot is firmly placed on the floor, bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight towards the right foot. Continue shifting your weight over the right foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your right knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your right foot. The goal is to sit deep into the lunge brining the glutes level with the right knee. Your left leg should be at full extension at the knee and your body weight should still be distributed into the right hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Push through your right heel and lift the left leg off the floor bringing it in to starting position.
 
Step 5
Continue into the next over/under until you reach the end.  Facing the same direction, come back down the line leading with your left foot. 
 

When stepping over the broomstick, be sure not to step too wide to avoid contacting the broomstick with the extended leg.  Contacting the broom stick a can cause it to move resulting in a loss of balance and injury.  A common mistake when performing a body weight side lunge is that individuals often step too wide and are unable to align the tibia (shinbone) over the placed foot and the knee falls inside the foot. In this case, simply shorten the width of the step taken to allow you to align the tibia over the placed foot.

Starting Position: Stand to the side of the hurdles so that they are lying to your left, your feet should be hip-width apart with the knees slightly bent.  Bend your hips and drop into an athletic ready position so that your knees are slightly bent and your chest is directly over your toes.  Your arms should be bent with the elbows fixed at approximately ninety degrees (during the drill ensure that the swinging is coming from the shoulder joint and not from the elbows).  Shift your bodyweight so that your weight is in your right leg.  Pick the left foot up so the left hip is at ninety degrees and prepare to place the left foot on the ground beween the first two hurdles while pushing the right foot in to the ground to move your body to your left.  Maintain an abdominal contraction and straight spine during this drill and keep your feet parallel so your toes are pointed straight ahead (in the same direction that you are facing).
 
Step 2
When your left foot hits the ground, shift your bodyweight into your left leg, pick up the right foot to the point where the right hip is approximately ninety degrees, lift the foot over the hurdle and bring it to the ground next to the left foot.
 
Step 3
Explosively push your right foot into the ground and pick up the left foot until the point where the left hip achieves approximately ninety degrees of flexion and continue running over the hurdles allowing both feet to touch the space in between each individual hurdle.
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: Once you have run over the hurdles moving to your right, change directions and run over the hurdles moving to your left.  Once you establish the rythym and pace of the movement, keep your head and eyes raised so that you are looking straight ahead where your opponent would be during an athletic competition.
Make sure to land softly as you step between the hurdles, land on the ball of the foot and roll down to the heel and keep your weight back in your hips and you run through the drill.

Starting Position: Place a series of cones 18-24"" apart in a straight line on a non-slip surface. Stand 3-6"" to your left of the first cone with your feet hip-width apart or closer, arms by your sides. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and position your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards through your lower extremity over the top of the first cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
 
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity over the second cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 8
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward, upward (towards an overhead position) and slightly sideways in your jumping direction during the jumping phases, (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases, (4) increasing the height of each cone or the spacing between each cone, or (5) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more cones and performing a greater number of jumps in each direction.
 
Learn first how to squat and perform regular squat jumps before attempting to jump laterally.

Starting Position: From a kneeling position place the left knee on the floor (or stretch mat) directly under the left hip, and place the right foot in front of the right hip so that the right knee is directly over the right ankle and the right hip is in a position of ninety (90) degrees.  Place both hands gently on the right thigh to help maintain a straight, tall spine.
 
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine and keep your pelvis level (and stable).  Lean forward into your right hip while keeping your left knee pressed into the ground, do not allow your pelvis to rotate to the anterior (forward).  To increase the stretch to the left hip flexors, squeeze and contract the glute muscles of your left hip.
 
Step 3
Hold the stretch position for 30-45 seconds at a time for a total of 2-5 repetitions; try to move into the stretch a little deeper with each repetition, but be sure to keep your core braced to not allow the pelvis to rotate and lose the stretch.  Complete all repetitions on one side before alternating to the other hip.
 
Step 4  
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the stretch raise the left arm straight in the air and tilt slightly to the right side and you lean forward into the right hip; be sure to alternate sides.
Keep the abdominals engaged throughout the entire stretch, this will ensure that the pelvis remains level and will provide the greatest results from the stretch.  To reduce any soreness in the knee on the ground, place an Airex pad or a rolled-up stretch mat under the knee.

As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor as you explode your arms forward and throw them up in the air reaching overhead to help create upwards momentum away from the ground.
 
Step 3
Extend all the way through the body to create a straight line from your toes up through you arms and out of your hands.  When landing, land on the mid-foot rolling backwards towards the heels.  Push your hips backwards and downwards to absorb the impacting (ground) forces associated with landing.  Attempt to land softly and quietly and avoid locking out your knees on the landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
Exercise Variation: To increase the level of difficulty do a knee tuck and pull your knees up towards your chest as you are jumping into the air.
 
Before jumping become familiar with the movement mechanics by doing a few squats where you squat back into your heels and sink into your hips with your arms extended behind you, stand up from the squat while swinging your arms forward and roll up on your toes, then sink back into your heels; repeat for 4-6 repetitions.

Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back while keeping your arms hanging comfortably along your side.
Step 2
Keep the right foot planted on the ground, (maintain balance through the movement by pressing the right foot into the ground while extending the leg and squeezing (contracting) both the thigh and glute muscles), lift the left knee so that it is straight in front of the hip and the hip is at a ninety degree angle.  Bend the arms at ninety degree angles, as you raise the left knee, swing the right arm forward to flex the right shoulder while swinging left arm back to create shoulder extension.
Step 3
Maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the core stiff and the spine straight, lean forward on the right hip while simultaneously extending the left hip behind your body, at the same time reach forward with the right arm to create right shoulder flexion and move the left elbow back to create left shoulder extension.  Keep the right foot firmly planted into the ground to maintain balance and stability.
Step 4
Continue flexing forward on the right hip (continue squeezing the right thigh and glutes to help maintain stability) while reaching forward with the left arm and extending the right leg backwards (into hip extension).  To help maintain balance, find a spot on the floor and fix your gaze on that spot, this will create additional stability.
Step 5
At the point where you feel your end range-of-motion while balanced on your right leg, reach forward with the left arm to fully extend the elbow while flexing the shoulder at the same time extend the left leg straight back to create full hip extension.  Point the toes of the left foot towards the wall behind you in order to move into full extension of the left hip (and concurrent flexion of the right hip); continue to maintain abdominal bracing to ensure balance and stability.  Try to keep the hips level and do not let the left hip drop towards the floor or roll away from the right (planted) leg.  Hold this position for 3-5 seconds.
Step 6
Maintain abdominal bracing and begin to lean back into the right hip while pulling the left hip forward (back into flexion) and the left arm back down towards your midsection.  Return to an upright, standing position and repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time.  Alternate legs and repeat for the same number of repetitions or period of time.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: To add resistance and increase the level of difficulty, hold a dumbbell in your left hand (the weight should be in the hand opposite of the standing (balance) leg).
 

If balancing on the right leg, use the left leg to help move into a position of flexion on the right hip; pointing the left leg backwards while pointing the toes and straightening the legs will help move the right hip into a position of flexion.

This exercise is a dynamic movement exercise used to prepare the body for activity. As it involves a modification to a traditional push-up, it is highly recommended you master your push-up technique before attempting this exercise.
Step 2
Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward or turned slightly inward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"")and glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles), and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Rotational Movement: Exhale and gently draw one knee up towards your chest, bending the knee and flexing at the hip. Do NOT allow your hips and low back to pitch upwards or sag down towards the floor.
Step 4
In this knee-tuck position, rotate your hips to move your bent leg across the front of your torso, but avoid rotating or dropping your hips. Continue to move until your hips cannot rotate any further. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise. Pause very briefly.

Starting Position: While standing, position your feet shoulder-width apart, side-by-side, with your toes pointed forward or slightly outward. Take a light bar and place it behind your head grasping the end with one hand above your head and the other end with your opposite hand in the small of your back so that your hand touches your low back. Stand vertical so the bar makes contact with the back of your head, your thoracic spine (between your shoulder blades) and your sacrum (butt).
Step 2
Downward Phase: Gently exhale and begin the movement by shifting your weight onto your heels, then pushing your hips backwards towards the wall behind you and hinge forward at the hips. Move to an end position where your torso is midway between vertical and parallel to the floor allowing only slight movement (bending) at the knees throughout this movement. The bar must continue to remain in contact with the back of your head, thoracic spine and sacrum, and your lower hand must remain in contact with your low back (to prevent any arching).
Step 3
Upward Phase: Gently inhale and slowly return to your upright, standing position by contracting your glutes and pushing your hips forwards and upward. The bar must remain in contact with the three points throughout this phase.
Technique is very important in this lift. This exercise teaches the correct technique for performing a squat and is strongly encouraged as a pre-requisite to learning how to squat correctly.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/207/hexagon-drill/","Step 1
Starting Position: Set up six cones in a hexagon, making each segment about 2 feet long.  Each cone should be about 2-3 feet from the center point allowing enough room for you to take a large step.  Stand in the middle of the hexagon in line with a cone.  This will be your starting point.  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up.  Shift your weight over your heels.

Step 2
Ready Position:  Maintaining abdominal bracing, bend the knees and hinge at the hips (shift hips back) bringing the torso forward.  Allow the arms to flex (bend) at the elbow and remain close to your sides.  Shift your weight to the balls of your feet.

Step 3
Action:  With the left leg, take a large step forward toward the cone into a lunge while simultaneously driving and extending the right arm forward and down, palms facing in, to the lightly touch the top of the come.  Drive your left elbow backwards.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center.

Step 4
Moving counter clockwise to the next cone (left front rotational), rotate to the left, pivoting off your right foot and lunging with your left leg aligning your feet and hips in the direction you are stepping (toward the cone). Follow the same technique as listed in step 3.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center. 

Step 5
Continue counter clock-wise until you reach your starting point.  Repeat the drill lunging forward with your right foot and moving clock-wise.

Step 6
Exercise Variations:  (1) Perform this drill extending the same side arm toward the cone.  In this case, the opposite elbow would drive back behind the body.  (2) Once you become comfortable with the oblique angle lunges, you can focus more on exploding to the cone.  To increase the amount of explosion, widen the hexagon allowing you to take a couple steps forward then lunge to touch each cone.  Placing a cone in the middle will provide a reference point. 
 

It would be beneficial to practice the directional movements with stepping first to make sure your hip and foot alignment is correct before moving to the lunge. You may also have to adjust the size of the hexagon to a distance appropriate for you to perform the exercise correctly. Keep your arm movements strong and controlled.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or the floor in a bent-knee position with your feet flat on the floor and your arms resting comfortably along your side with the palms rotated up to face the ceiling. Start with your feet hip-width apart with the toes facing away from you, lift the left leg and place both hands on the back of the thigh to gently pull your left knee towards your chest, slide the right foot in (towards the center of the body). Gently contract your abdominal muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this abdominal stiffness throughout the exercise. 
 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and the back of your left thigh; press your right foot into the ground and lift upwards off the floor into hip extension by contracting (squeezing) your right glute (butt muscle). At the same time press your right heel into the floor for more stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back.
 
Step 3
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position by controlling the action of the right hip.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time; then alternate legs. 
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: To increase the strength of the muscles along the front of the shin (anterior tibilias) pick the toes of the right foot off of the floor to hold the foot in dorsiflexion-this is a good option for runners because it could help reduce the risk of developing shin splints.
Exhale as your push your leg into the ground, inhale on the lowering phase.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet together and your arms raised in front to shoulder height, with your elbows fully extended. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
From the same starting position, step out sideways with the right foot (both feet remain pointed forward) to the 3 o'clock position. Once the foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight over that same foot. Continue shifting your weight until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your knee is aligned directly over the second toe of that foot. Your left leg should be near, or at full extension while keeping the right foot flat. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor.
 
Step 3
While lunging, simultaneously move your arms and lean your torso in the opposite direction to the lunge movement, increasing the load on your glute muscle group. Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
 
Step 4
From the same starting position, step with one foot in front and across the body (both feet remain pointed forward). Once the foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight over that same foot. Continue shifting your weight until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your knee is aligned directly over the second toe of that foot. Your opposite leg should be flexed with the heel off the ground.
 
Step 5
While lunging, simultaneously rotate your torso and arms in the opposite direction to the lunge movement, increasing the load on your gluteal muscle group. Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
This series of multi-directional (multi-planar) lunges are intended to activate your glutes which protect your knee during walking, running and jumping-type activities. As many of us have weak glutes, this exercise can be performed as part of your pre-exercise warm-up. Given the moderate degree of complexity of the three movements, we recommend learning this exercise first without your arms and only progress to the arm drivers as you feel comfortable. It is suggested, you first learn how to perform single leg-stands on the ground and forward lunges before performing these glute activation lunges.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, facing outward or turned slightly outwards while holding a dumbbell in each hand by your sides, with palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Curl the dumbbells to a starting position where they rest on the front edge of your shoulders or just in front of your shoulders. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, and shift your weight over your heels.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe.
 
Step 5
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding.
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent excess arching in the back with this correction.

Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and extend your arms to reach directly behind you while keeping the elbows straight.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode forward and upwards through your lower extremity while throwing your arms overhead to achieve triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet next to each other.
 
Step 4
While in the air traveling forward pull your legs in front of you while keeping your feet next to each other in order to prepare for the landing.  Your head should be level with your eyes looking to the spot on the floor where you want to land.
 
Step 5
Your legs should be in front of you with the feet parallel next to each other, bend the knees and flex the hips to prepare to absorb the impact forces of the landing.  Keep your eyes on the floor to prepare for the landing.
 
Step 6
Landing phase: Keep your feet parallel next to each other and attempt to land softly on the whole foot, let the balls of the feet hit the ground first and quickly roll down to your heels while sinking your weight back into your heels and hips.  Use the rapid bending of the hips and knees to absorb the impact forces of the landing, do not land with a straight or hyper-extended knee as this could create an injury.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: Perform multiple jumps in a row, minimize the amount of time on the ground, as soon as you land and absorb the forces in the legs and hips explode off the ground into the next jump.
Your body will follow your eyes so be sure to look to the spot on the floor where you want to land and keep your legs and hips soft, ready to absorb the impact forces upon landing.

Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and position your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode forward and upwards through your lower extremity over the top of the first cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
 
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode forward and upwards again through your lower extremity over the second cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. Continue this process until you have cleared all the cones.
 
Step 8
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward and upward (towards an overhead position) during the jumping phases, (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases, (4) increasing the height of each cone or the spacing between each cone, or (5) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more cones and performing a greater number of jumps in each direction.
Learn first how to squat and perform regular squat jumps before attempting to jump the cones.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly lift yourself into a push-up position, shifting your hands until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles to prevent any arching in your low back or hiking of your hips towards the ceiling.
 
Step 2
Upward Phase: While maintaining a rigid torso and full extension in your arms and legs, slowly exhale and shift your weight backwards by pushing your hips backwards and upwards. Maintain your head alignment with your spine, but slowly move your head between your shoulders as your body moves backwards and attempt to push your heels towards the floor. Maintain the stiffness in your torso to prevent the tendency of your back to arch. Continue moving until your body forms an inverted-V, keeping both arms and legs extended and a neutral (flat) spine. Allow a slight bend in the knees if required to achieve the inverted-V position.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and return your body to the starting push-up position, maintaining the alignment of all your body segments.

Starting Position: Stand in an athletic ready position with your feet hip-width apart, your right leg forward, left leg back, with both arms bent at the elbows and the left arm in front of your body and right arm back behind your body.  Prepare for the jump by leaning forward hinging at the hips, while simultaneously keeping your weight back in your thighs, depressing and retracting your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Jumping Movement: Quickly sink your weight back into your hips then explosively push both feet into the floor and driving your hips forward to accelerate your body into the air achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously) in both legs. As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
 
Step 3
While you are in the air cycle your legs by moving your left leg forward in front of your body, your right leg backwards behind your body; cycle your arms with your legs so that as your left leg comes forward your right arm comes forward and as your right leg moves back your left arm moves back.
 
Step 4
Downward phase: As you land your left leg should be in front of your body and your right leg back behind your body. The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.  Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.  Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.


Step 5
Exercise Variation: Be sure to alternate the forward leg, when learning this exercise focus first on landing with control and resetting before another repetition, as you improve your strength and power progress to performing multiple jumps in a row.
 

It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and land before attempting to jump. Once you have mastered the hip-hinge mechanism, begin with small jumps, but emphasize your landing mechanics. Only progress to more explosive jumps once you have mastered your landing mechanics.

Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull the shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe. 
 
Step 5
From the Lowered Position: the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position. 
 
Think about inhaling on the way down and exhaling while exerting on the way back to the initial standing position.

Starting Position: Place the end of a standard barbell in a corner so that it will not move unnecessarily, place a weight on one end of the barbell with a collar so that the weight can not fall off during the exercise.  Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, your toes pointed forward or slightly outward facing the end of the barbell so that it is between both feet and directly under your center of gravity.
 
Step 2
Squat down by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees, as you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward.  Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar). Position the end of the bar directly in front of your chest directly under your chin. Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward.
 
Step 3
Upward phase:  Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest.  Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position.
 
Step 4
As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
 
Step 5
As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension).
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise.
Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance. 


Technique is very important in this lift. Do not progress to explosive movements until you master your technique.

Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine. 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: When you are learning this exercise focus on the soft landing and reset your body in the correct position for the next jump and pause for a moment between jumps to ensure good form.  As you improve minimize the rest time so that you are rapidly moving from one jump to the next. 
 
When jumping keep your spine straight and tall by contacting your abdominals (bracing) and be sure to perform the same number of repetitions on each leg.

Starting Position: Stand directly in a square at one end of the ladder with your feet approximately hip-width apart.
 
Step 2
Bend your hips and drop into an athletic ready position so that your knees are slightly bent and your chest is directly over your toes.  Your arms should be bent with the elbows fixed at approximately ninety degrees (during the drill ensure that the swinging is coming from the shoulder joint and not from the elbows).
 
Step 3
Shift your bodyweight so that your weight is in your left leg.  Pick up the right foot and place it in the square next to the starting square while pushing the left foot in to the ground to move your body to your right and in to the next square of the ladder.
 
Step 4
Your right foot should hit the ground at the ball of the foot and roll all the way down to the heel, as the entire right foot hits the ground shift your body weight off of the left leg and place your weight on the right leg.  Once your bodyweight is on your right leg pick up your left foot to bring it into the same square as the right foot.  Keep your hips flexed and knees bent so that you maintain an athletic ready position throughout the length of the entire ladder.
 
Step 5
Continue to move down the ladder to your right; keep the bodyweight in the left leg while picking up the right foot to move it to the next square to the right; as the right foot hits the square, push off with the left foot and keep the bodyweight centered on top of the right leg.  Be sure to move both ways through the ladder; once you've done a certain number of repetitions to the right, be sure to switch directions and do the same number of repetitions moving to your left (pushing off of the right foot).  
 
Exercise Variation: As you improve your movement skills, dynamic balance and ability to move rapidly through the ladder, try not to look at your feet and keep your eyes on the horizon (where your opponents will be during an athletic competition).
