Starting Position: Holding two dumbbells, kneel and rest your elbows on a bench with approximately a 90 degree bend at the elbows and the dumbbells hanging freely off the edge of the pad. Position your forearms into neutral with the dumbbells vertical to the floor (rotate forearms to face palms inward) keeping your wrists in a neutral position (not in flexion or extension).
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly pronate your forearms (rotate the dumbbells towards the floor) while maintaining a neutral wrist (not in flexion nor extension). Avoid releasing your grip, extending your arms, leaning forward / backward or any rapid, jerking movements. Hold this end position briefly.
 
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly supinate your forearms (rotate the dumbbells towards the ceiling) while maintaining a neutral wrist (not in flexion nor extension). Avoid releasing your grip, extending your arms, leaning forward / backward or any rapid, jerking movements. Hold this end position briefly and repeat the entire sequence.
Exercise technique is important to avoid potential injury, control the movement of your dumbbells by slowing down the movement speed at the end ranges of motion in each direction. For additional strength gains, think about squeezing the handle of the dumbbell as hard as possible during both phases of the movement.

Starting Position: Holding two dumbbells, kneel and rest your elbows on a bench with approximately a 90 degree bend at the elbows and the dumbbells hanging freely off the edge of the pad. Supinate your forearms (rotate the forearms so that the tops are along the bench and the palms are facing upward) keep your wrists in a neutral position (not in flexion or extension).
Step 2
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly allow the wrists to move into extension (allow dumbbells to move towards the floor) without releasing your grip, extending your arms or leaning forward / backward. Hold this end position briefly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly contract your forearm flexor muscles (along the top of the forearm) rolling your wrists towards you in order to return the dumbbells back to the starting position.
Individuals sometimes release their grip during the lowering phase, allowing the dumbbells to roll towards their finger tips. While this may increase the load on the forearm muscles, it also increases the risk of wrist injury and dropping the dumbbells. To increase strength think about squeezing the weights as hard as possible during both phases of the movement.

Starting Position: Place your feet securely into the foot cradles positioned directly under the anchor point. Apply downward pressure with the tops of your feet by plantarflexing your ankles (toes point away from your shins). Gently lie flat on your stomach with your hands placed shoulder-width apart, under your shoulders and facing forward. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles (""bracing""), and your glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles).
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press yourself upward until your elbows are fully extended, aligning your head and spine (avoid any sagging or aching in your low back or hips hiking upwards). Keep your feet together throughout the exercise and avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Maintaining your rigid torso, inhale and slowly lower your body towards the floor, touching your chin or upper chest to the floor. Again, avoid any arching or sagging in your low back.
Step 4
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by lengthening the straps and positioning your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX.
Using the TRX certainly enhances the appeal of many exercises; however, trainers and individuals should not participate in these advanced exercises until they can demonstrate capability to effectively stabilize their lumber spine (low back) with their core muscles.

Keep your head aligned with your spine, and avoiding any sagging in the low back.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly flex (bend) your right elbow by pulling your entire body away from your arm. Your right elbow should move towards the right side of your body, your body should not rotate and your wrist should remain in the neutral position. Maintain a stiff torso with your head and spine aligned, and avoid any sagging or aching in your low back or hips.
Step 4
Downward Phase: While maintaining your rigid torso, inhale and slowly lower your body back towards your starting position, extending (straightening) your elbow without your shoulder rolling forward. Keep your head and spine aligned together.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): Change to a high-back row by raising the elbow to shoulder height during the pull movement. This places more emphasis on the posterior deltoids and muscles in the upper back.
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2) To increase the intensity of this exercise, lengthen the straps and position your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX, or change the foot position so that the ipsilateral (same side) leg is forward.

Starting Position: Stand facing the cable machine and position the cable attachment at a height above your head. Attach the handle or rope and grasp it firmly with a full grip (thumbs clasped around the handle or rope).  Position your feet hip-width apart or in a staggered-stance (walking) position. Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine with a natural arch in your low back, keeping your torso aligned vertically with the floor and maintaining this position throughout the exercise.
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.  Slowly press the handles / rope down to the starting positon where your elbows are aligned with the mid-point of your trunk, arms postioned firmly by sides and wrists in neutral positon (i.e., aligned with your forearms).  This arm and wrist position should be maintained throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly extend your elbows, pressing the handle / rope down towards the floor. Maintain your torso, shoulder, arm and wrist position throughout the movement

Step 3
Continue pressing the weight with your elbows right next to your side while maintaining a neutral position with your wrists until your elbows become fully extended, (do not allow them to ""lock out"" in full extension).  Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position, allowing your elbows to flex (bend) in a slow, controlled manner moving the handle / rope upwards until your elbows begin to drift forward from the mid-line of your trunk (around upper chest level).  Repeat the movement.
 
Step 4
Exercise Variation: This exercise can also be performed unilaterally (one arm at a time )
 

While this exercise targets the triceps effectively, proper technique is important to emphasize these muscles. It is important to monitor the forward movement of your elbows as this recruits from your lats (back muscles) and reduces the emphasis on the triceps.

Place your right hand on your right thigh or knee and slowly lean forward, transferring most of your upper extremity body weight into that right side. Depress and retract your left scapula (pull your shoulder down and back) and maintain this position throughout the exercise. Your head should be aligned with your spine.
 
Step 2
Position the your left upper arm parallel to, and close to, your torso. Bend your elbow to 90 degrees or at least to a point where your forearm hangs vertical to the floor.
 
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly extend (straighten) your elbow by contracting your triceps muscles until your elbow is fully extended. Your upper arm should remain stationary next to your torso and not raised during the movement. Avoid any arching (sagging) in your low back or any rotation in your torso.
 
Step 4
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly return your arm to your starting position, without changing your torso position. Maintain your upper arm parallel and close to your torso.
Proper form in performing this exercise is important to target triceps activity and for safety reasons to prevent additional loading on your spine.

Starting Position: Stand in a split-stance position holding a dumbbell with both hands and wrap both hands around the dumbbell handle. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal/core muscles (""bracing""), and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back), maintaining this position throughout the exercise. Your head and neck should be aligned with your spine. 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press the dumbbell overhead, extending your elbows until your arms are vertical to the floor, elbows pointing forward, but not completely locked. The dumbbell should be positioned directly over your head with your palms facing upwards and the dumbbell hanging vertically or angled slightly. Maintain your balance and avoid changing the position of your head, torso, upper arms, wrists and feet. 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and allow the weight to slowly bend your elbows, lowering the dumbbell behind your head in a controlled manner without moving your upper arms. Continue lowering the dumbbell until your elbows reach a 90 degree bend or until your upper arms begin to move backwards. Be sure to avoid making contact with the back of your head. Also, avoid changing the position in your head, torso, upper arms, wrists and feet. 
Attempt to keep your upper arms vertical to the floor throughout the exercise and your elbows shoulder-width apart.

Step 2
Bending at the hips, reach forward with your right arm straight and elbow extended and place it on the table.  Maintain abdominal bracing to keep the spine in alignment.  Keeping both shoulders square to the front, flex (bend) your left elbow lifting your forearm up and forming a 90 degree angle at that elbow. 
 
Begin extending the shoulder by maintaining the 90 degree bend in the left elbow and drawing the elbow up and back so your hand is now pointing to the ground.  Increase the stretch by keeping the shoulder in place and extending the elbow, straightening the arm with your thumb pointing down.
 
Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds for a total of 2-4 repetitions.  Do not allow your head to drop towards the ground. Keep your gaze on the table.
 
 

Keep your body square to the table.  Avoid leaning into the support arm and opening the chest.  Keep your abdominals engaged to support the back.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place one hand on the top of medicine ball and the other on the floor. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart. Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing""). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your torso to rotate, your low back or hips to sag or pitch upwards. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thighs) to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back or hips to sag or hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
As the ball adds instability to this exercise, your movements need to be slow and controlled to reduce the chance of injury.

Starting Position: Sit with your back firmly supported against the backrest. Adjust the seat height so that the handles are level with your shoulders or just higher than your shoulders. Grasp the handles firmly with a full grip (thumbs clasped around the handles) and maintain a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrists in line with your forearms). Position your elbows in the 4 and 8 o'clock position (i.e., slightly forward than the 3 and 9 o'clock positions where the elbows are aligned with the midline of your trunk).  Position your feet firmly on the floor or on the foot rests to stabilize your body.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the backrest. Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly perform an upward pressing movement, extending your elbows overhead while maintaining a neutral wrist position, head aligned with your spine and avoidng arching your low back.

Step 3
Continue pressing until your elbows are fully extended, but not locked.  Pause momentarily then gently contract your lats (back muscles) to pull the handles back down towards your starting position, allowing your elbows to flex (bend) in a slow, controlled manner while returning to their starting 4 and 8 o'clock position. Repeat the movement.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity, perform the following variations:
(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) presses
(b) Sit upright off the backrest, which will require a greater effort from your core to stabilize your trunk as you perform the press movement.
 

In the overhead position, the shoulder is relatively unstable. To protect your shoulder it is important to engage your lats (back muscles) to initiate the downward movement as oppsed to simply yielding to gravity. This will help stabilize your shoulder.

Starting Position: Adjust the seat height to a level that positions the machine handles approximately level, or near level, with your shoulders. Position your feet firmly on the floor or foot pads to stabilize your body.  Sit upright and extend your arms to grasp the handles without rounding your shoulders forward. Adjust the position the chest pad to contact your chest lightly.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the back rest. Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down), maintain a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrist in line with your forearms) and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.
 
Step 2
From this start position with your tors0 vertical, scapulae (shoulder blades) flat against your ribcage and arms extended, gently exhale and perform a pulling movement. Flex (bend) your elbows and pull them towards your chest keeping your elbows close to the sides of your body.  Continue to maintain a neutral wrist position, and contact with your chest against the chest pad.  Avoid leaning back and arching your low back and attempt to minimize any movement of your head during the movement.

Step 3
Continue pulling until your elbows pass the sides of your body. Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position, allowing your arms to move forward and elbows to extend (straighten) in a slow, controlled manner, moving the handles away from your body, stopping when your arms are fully extended. Maintain your upright trunk position and avoid forward rounding of your scapulae (shoulder blades). Repeat the movement.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity and involve additional exercises, perform the following variations:
(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) pulls
(b) Move the chest pad away from your body, which will now require a greater effort to stabilize your trunk as you perform the pulling movement.
 

Allowing your shoulders to round forward as your arms extend will allow you to pull with more force. However, learn how to perform a pulling motion without scapulae (shoulder blade) movement first before introducing shoulder movement.  Additionally, reduce unnecessary stresses into your low back by avoiding any backwards lean during the pull movements.

Starting Position: Grasp the dumbbells in your hands and sit with your back against a back rest so that your head, shoulders and butt make contact with the bench. Place your feet firmly on the floor. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing""). If working with a spotter, signal for assistance. Exhale and slowly lift the dumbbells to your shoulder level with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward and thumbs wrapped around the handles), with the dumbbells at shoulder-width or slightly wider and wrists in a neutral position (avoid flexion and extension of the wrists). Retract and depress your scapulae (pull down and back) and hold this scapulae position throughout the exercise. 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and press the dumbbells overhead in unison until your elbows are fully extended without any arching in your low back. Maintain your body contact with the bench, neutral wrist (avoid flexion and extension) and depressed, retracted scapulae positions. For more comfort through the range-of-motion keep your elbows pointed in front of you.

Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down), maintain a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrist in line with your forearms) and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.

Step 2
From this start position with your torso vertical, scapulae (shoulder blades) flat against your ribcage and arms extended, gently exhale and perform a pulling movement. Flex (bend) your elbows and pull them towards your chest, but try to flair your elbows out from your sides, keeping them as level with your shoulders as possible. Continue to maintain a neutral wrist position, and contact with your chest against the chest pad.  Avoid leaning back and arching your low back and attempt to minimize any movement of your head during the movement.

Step 3
Continue pulling until your elbows reach level with, or pass just behind your shoulders. Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position, allowing the weight to pull your arms to move forward and elbows to extend (straighten) in a slow, controlled manner; the weight should straighten your arms but use your back muscles to resist the pull as the handles move away from your body, stopping when your arms are fully extended.  Maintain an upright trunk position with your spine straight and your chest lifted upwards toward the ceiling.  Do not let your spine bend forward and your back to round during this exercise.  Repeat the movement for a specific number of repetitions.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity and involve additional exercises, perform the following variations:
(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) pulls
(b) Move the chest pad away from your body, which will now require a greater effort to stabilize your trunk as you perform the pulling movement.
 

Allowing your shoulders to round forward as your arms extend will allow you to pull with more force. However, learn how to perform a pulling motion without scapulae (shoulder blade) movement first before introducing shoulder movement.  Additionally, reduce unnecessary stresses into your low back by avoiding any backwards lean during the pull movements.

Starting Position: Sit with your back firmly supported against the backrest. Adjust the seat height so that the handles are level with your mid-chest and the handles are positioned no deeper than chest level (level with the front of your chest). Grasp the handles firmly with a full grip (thumbs clasped around the handles) and maintain a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrists in line with your forearms)and bring your elbwos down to the sides of your body.  Position your feet firmly on the floor or on the foot rests to stabilize your body.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the backrest. Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly perform a pressing movement, extending your elbows in front, while maintaining a neutral wrist position, head aligned with your spine and avoid arching your low back.

Step 3
Continue pressing until your elbows are fully extended, but not locked.  Your shoulder blades should continue to make contact with the backrest and not round themselves forward.  Pause momentarily then gently allow your elbows to flex (bend) in a slow, controlled manner while returning the bar back towards the starting position. Repeat the movement.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity, perform the following variations:
(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) presses
(b) Sit upright off the backrest, which will require a greater effort from your core to stabilize your trunk as you perform the press movement.
 

This position is more comfortable and less stressful on the shoulder joint and more appropriate for individuals who experience some discomfort when performing traditional chest presses as it shifts more load into the triceps and off the shoulder joint.

Starting Position: Sit with your back against a back rest so that your head, shoulders and butt make contact with the bench and place your feet firmly on the floor. Grasp two dumbbells with a closed, supinated grip (palms facing forward and thumbs wrapped around the handles) and let your arms hang to your sides, close to your body, with your palms facing forward. Depress and retract (push down and back) your scapulae (shoulders).
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly bend each elbow in unison, bringing the dumbbells towards your chest without arching your back or moving your elbows forward. Maintain a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion and extension of your wrists) and keep contact with your head, shoulder and butt against the bench. Keep your feet firmly placed on the floor and avoid shrugging your shoulders during the lift keeping your scapulae (shoulders) depressed and retracted.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and gently lower the dumbbells back towards your starting position.
Step 4
Variation to this exercise: To emphasize more biceps activity change your starting position. Turn your palms towards your sides and rotate them forward (or up) during the upward phase before your forearms reach horizontal. During the downward phase rotate your forearms back inward as your forearms reach horizontal. Curl the dumbbells higher by allowing the elbows to move forward as the dumbbell reaches your chest, moving the upper arm towards horizontal with the floor. This places a little more emphasis on the biceps and some anterior shoulder muscles.
As some of us show structural differences at the elbow, we may not be able to hold the dumbbells against our sides in the lowered position unless we force a bend at our wrists. The dumbbell position selected should be one that is most comfortable for you and keeps the wrists aligned straight with the forearm.

Starting Position: Assume a seated bent-knee position, feet placed flat on the floor / mat and arms outstretched behind you with your palms flat on the floor / mat and fingers pointed away from your body.  Adjust your position to distribute your weight evenly between your feet, butt and arms, keeping your back supported in a relatively flat position (i.e., avoid arching or slumping) and head aligned with your spine.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly slide your butt forwards towards your feet without moving your hands. This should create a stretch through your biceps with some stretching in the anterior (front) shoulder region (anterior shoulder and chest stretch). Push yourself forward to the point of tension in the stretch, but never bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times. 

Step 3
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing, and to control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, avoid any change of position of your spine (i.e., avoid arching or slumping).

Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"") and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase, contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to create stability for your core. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or be allowed to flare outwards slightly.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. As your press upwards, extend your left hip to lift your left foot off the floor, keeping the knee extended. Attempt to avoid rotation in your hip as you raise the left leg off the floor. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows and your left leg is extended off the floor. Hold this position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat with your opposite leg
Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.

Step 4
Exercise Variation:  The intensity of this exercise can be increased with resistance that can be added by wearing a weight belt to which weights are connected.  Using a narrow, prontated (palms forward) grip shifts some of the load from your lats (mid-back muscles) into the muscles of the upper back.

Starting Position: You and a training partner should have specialized resistance x-pattern resistance tubing with four handles so that two people can use it at the same time; or take 2 pieces of standard resistance tubing with handles and cross them to interlink them and create a 4-handled pattern (pictured).  You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; lean forward to hinge at your hips with your knees slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability.  You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) and the scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together).  You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your heads in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).  Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing each other and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull.  
Step 2
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core.  At the same time you and your partner should each pull back on the handles, the pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades (which are rectraced), use your triceps (upper arm muscles) to extend (straighten) your arms directly behind you.
Step 3
When you and your partner have each extended (straightened) your arms, you should continue to maintain spinal stability while holding the arms in a straight line and pushing against the resistance.
Step 4
You and your partner should simultaneously allow your right arm to flex (bend) slowly at the elbow working against and decelerating the pull of the resistance while holding the left arm in a straight line of elbow extension. 
Step 5
You and your partner should each simultaneously engage the upper muscles (triceps) of the right arm to push the resistance back while extending (straightening) the arm while simultaneously allowing the left arm to slowly flex (bend) at the elbow while working against the pull of the elastic resistance.  Continue alternating the action of the arms; you and your partner should each hold your right arm in extension while bending and straightening the left arm, then alternate to hold the left arm straight in extension while bending and straightening the right arm. 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the exercise, stand further away from your partner to create more resistance through the rubber resistance, or increase the speed (velocity) of the movement for enhanced power production and work-rate.

Remember to keep your feet planted into the floor with your abdominals engaged and contracted (braced) to ensure spinal stability.

Starting Position: You and a training partner should have specialized resistance x-pattern resistance tubing with four handles so that two people can use it at the same time; or take 2 pieces of standard resistance tubing with handles and cross them to interlink them and create a 4-handled pattern.  You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; your knees and hips should be slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability.  You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together).  You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).  Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing the ground and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull. 
Step 2
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core.  At the same time you and your partner should each pull back on the handles, the pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades (which are rectraced), continue holding on to the handles but think about pulling from the elbows to engage the upper back and shoulder muscles. 
Step 3
Once you and your partner have pulled the handles back (into shoulder extension) you each should hold your shoulder blades retracted in an isometric contraction.  With both arms held in an isometric contraction you and your partner should each allow your right arm to come forward in shoulder flexion (arm moving forward towards your training partner) while maintaining the left arm in a position of shoulder extension.
Step 4
Once you and your partner have each allowed your right arm to move forward and pulled it back, you each should keep the right elbow next to the body with the right shoulder held in an isometric contraction (allowing no movement) while you each reach the left arm forward (the shoulder moves into flexion).  Continue the abdominal bracing and alternate the arm movements, you and your partner should work together to provide resistance to one another while simultaneously pulling back on the bands to keep the tension.   
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Start with slow, steady consistent movements to become used to providing manual resistane through the tension of the rubber tubing; to increase the intensity you can either stand further away from each other to create additional tension on the rubber or increase the speed of the movement to make it more of a power-based exercise. 
Remember to keep your feet planted into the floor with your abdominals engaged and contracted (braced) to ensure spinal stability.

Starting Position:  From a standing position with your feet together or slightly apart, stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.   

Step 2
Gently exhale and bend forward from your hips (""hip hinging""), keeping your knees extended (but not locked), and extend your arms in front of your body while slowly lowering your torso towards the floor until you can place your fingers or palms of your hands on the floor in front of your body.  Maintaining a flat spine and a soft bend in your knees during this movement is acceptable.

Step 3
Slowly begin to walk your hands forward (6-12” or 12 ½ - 25 cm steps) without moving your feet (your heels will begin to rise off the floor).  Continue walking yourself forward until you reach a full-push-up position where your spine, hips and head are level with the floor (plank position).

Step 4
Perform one full push-up, lowering your chest and hips simultaneously to the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase.  Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.   

Step 5
Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms fully extend at the elbows.  Slowly begin walking your feet forward towards your hands, taking 6-12” steps without moving your hands.  Maintain a flat spine throughout and continue walking until your feet are close to your hands.  

Step 6
Repeat this movement and continue for 10 – 15 yards (9-13 m).

Step 7
Exercise Variation:  You can progress this exercise by adding multiple push-ups in the lowered position.

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to monitor the position of your spine throughout the exercise.  Focus on keeping your spine flat and avoid any rounding of your low back.  Smaller steps help maintain correct body position.  Reaching too far forward with your arms will put unnecessary stress on the shoulders.

Starting Position: Stand holding dumbbells in your hands with a closed, neutral grip (thumbs around the handles with your palms facing your body). Position the dumbbells alongside your thighs with your elbows fully extended. Assume a split-stance position to stabilize your body, stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal/core muscles (""bracing""), and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back), maintaining these positions throughout the exercise. Your head and neck should be aligned with your spine. 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly flex (bend) one or both elbows in unison until the dumbbell(s) near(s) the front of your shoulder. It performing alternating arm curls, the opposite arm should remain in the starting position. Perform the curl while keeping your torso erect (no arching your low back) or without moving your elbows forward. Maintain a neutral wrist position (wrist straight without any bend with your palms facing your body) and avoid shrugging your shoulders throughout the movement. 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and gently lower the dumbbells back towards your starting position until the elbow(s) is/are fully extended, keeping the dumbbell in the neutral position. Maintain your split-stance, torso and shoulder position and if performing alternating arm curls, repeat to the opposite side. 
As some of us show structural differences at the elbow, we may not be able to hold the dumbbells against our sides in the lowered position unless we force a bend at our wrists. The dumbbell position selected should be one that is most comfortable for you and keeps the wrists aligned straight with the forearm.

Starting Position: Grasp two dumbbells and lie supine (on your back) on a flat bench with your feet firmly placed on the floor or upon a raised platform to allow you to maintain a flat or neutral (flat) spine. If working with a spotter, signal the spotter for assistance in handing you your the dumbbells.
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) to make firm contact with the bench. Your head, shoulders, butt and feet should make contact with the bench and floor/riser throughout the exercise. Signal your spotter for assistance in moving to your starting position. Grasp each dumbbell with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward, thumbs wrapped around the handle), press the dumbbells to a position level with or just below your eyes with the elbows fully extended. Maintain a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion/extension at the wrist joint).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in unison and in a controlled movement towards your mid-chest, but moving slightly wider towards the armpits. Gently touch the dumbbells to your chest without bouncing, maintaining your neutral wrist position. Keep the elbows close to your sides (emphasizes more triceps) or flared out from the body (emphasizes more pectorals). Maintain all points of contact with the bench and floor/riser and avoid any arching in the low back.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and gently press upwards to full elbow extension with the dumbbells positioned at or just below the level of your eyes. Maintain your points of contact with the bench and floor/riser, avoid arching your back during the lift and maintain neutral wrist position throughout the movement.
Step 5
At the end of the set, signal your spotter to assist you in taking the dumbbells and maintain a firm grip until the dumbbells are taken from your hands.
Safety is very important in this exercise. A spotter should adopt a split-stance position or half-kneeling position with the hands positioned as close to the most distal (wrist) joint. Keep the hands near, but not touching the wrists unless needed.
