Starting Position: Place your feet securely into the foot cradles positioned directly under the anchor point. Apply downward pressure with the tops of your feet by plantarflexing your ankles (toes point away from your shins). Gently lie flat on your stomach with your hands placed shoulder-width apart, under your shoulders and facing forward. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles (""bracing""), and your glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles).
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press yourself upward until your elbows are fully extended, aligning your head and spine (avoid any sagging or aching in your low back or hips hiking upwards). Keep your feet together throughout the exercise and avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Maintaining your rigid torso, inhale and slowly lower your body towards the floor, touching your chin or upper chest to the floor. Again, avoid any arching or sagging in your low back.
Step 4
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by lengthening the straps and positioning your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX.
Using the TRX certainly enhances the appeal of many exercises; however, trainers and individuals should not participate in these advanced exercises until they can demonstrate capability to effectively stabilize their lumber spine (low back) with their core muscles.

Starting Position: Holding both TRX handles or foot cradles in your left hand, turn yourself to face away from the anchor point. Extend (straighten) your left elbow to chest height, position your wrist in neutral (straight, not bent) with your palm facing the floor. Retract and depress your left scapulae (pull your left shoulder down and back).
Step 2
Assume a split-stance position with the right foot forward, lunging forward slowly and allowing some bending at the hips until the straps become tight. Maintain this foot position throughout the exercise. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles (""bracing""). Gently lower your upper body towards your left hand while keeping the head and spine aligned, and avoiding any sagging in the low back.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly extend (straighten) your left elbow by pressing your entire body away from your arm. Your upper arm should remain level with your chest, your body should not rotate and your wrist should remain in the neutral (straight, not bent) position. Maintain a stiff torso aligning your head and spine, and avoid any sagging or arching in your low back or hips.
Step 4
Downward Phase: While maintaining your rigid torso, inhale and slowly lower your body back towards your starting position keeping your head aligned with your spine. Repeat to the opposite side, changing your arm and leg positions.
Step 5
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of this exercise lengthen the straps and position your body further away from under the anchor point, or change the foot position so that the ipsilateral (same-side) leg is forward.

Starting Position: Holding the TRX handles or foot cradles in each hand, turn yourself to face the anchor point with your feet wider than hip-width and both facing forward. Bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while maintaining your weight over your heels and using the TRX to assist you keep your balance. As your lean backwards, extend your arms forward at chest height with palms facing towards the floor. Keep your head up, looking forward throughout this movement.
Step 2
Rotation Movement: Exhale and slowly rotate your arms at the shoulders without turning your head until you reach a point of tension. The leading arm will rotate behind your torso while the trailing arm will simply move across the front of your body. Hold briefly, inhale, then exhale and rotate in the opposite direction.
Step 3
Exercise Variation (1): To progress the exercise and mimic the golf swing more closely try moving your feet together and change your starting position where you are not bending over, but assuming a slightly bent-knee (1/4 squat) position. Extend your arms forward towards your knees rather than to chest level (pushing down on the handles of foot cradles) and rotate as described above. This rotation will exhibit more pivoting off the back foot. Change your head position to look towards the floor.
Step 4
Exercise Variation (2): Progress the movement to a windmill to increase torso rotation for your golf swing. From the same starting position described in the first progression, rotate both arms together in each direction while keeping your head fixed and facing the floor. This movement will exhibit a greater degree of pivoting off the back foot.
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it requires additional attention to proper form.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs bent slightly deeper than 90 degrees at the hips, knees bent to 90 degrees, and feet overlapping each other.  Align your hips and shoulder vertically with the floor and spine and head in a straight line.  Extend your lower arm in front of your body at chest level, resting it upon the mat while reaching with your upper arm down under your trunk to firmly grasp your ribcage.  Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk by pulling the ribcage around with your upper arm.  Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, (indicated by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate).  Continue rotating your trunk until your reach the point of tension, avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  The deeper bend at the hips and abdominal stiffening will help prevent any arching in your low back during the stretch.  Grasping under your ribcage will ensure rotation, and stretching of, your trunk and reduce shoulder stress that often occurs when the arm is extended and allowed to fall towards the floor (refer progression).

Step 3
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then repeat to the opposite side.

Step 4
Progression 1: Extend the lower leg, while resting the inside of the upper knee on a small riser.  In this position, the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk, evidenced by a backwards slide of the upper knee during the rotation.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips while only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.

Step 5
Progression 2: Remove the riser under the upper knee and place it firmly against the mat / floor.  In this position, the upper knee may rise off the floor and the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips by pressing the knee into the floor and only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.

Step 6
Progression 3: Repeat the same exercise, but begin with both arms extended in front of your body at chest level.  As you begin to rotate, bend the upper elbow, sliding it towards your trunk, then extending the arm outwards again at chest level as you continue your rotation.  Continue your rotation until the point of tension in the trunk and shoulder, but avoid arching your back or rotating your hips. This will increase the stretch in the shoulder and chest region, in addition to your trunk.

To maximize the benefits of this stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to follow the instructions provided carefully.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or firm surface, bending your knees until your feet are positioned flat on the floor 12-18"" from your buttocks. Place your arms at your sides, with elbows fully extended and palms facing inward. Breathe deeply for a 30 seconds relaxing your body and allowing gravity to gently pull your lower back and shoulders towards the floor.
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulder down and back) without increasing the arch in your low back or lifting your hips off the mat / floor. Contract your abdominal / core muscles to flatten your low back into the mat and hold this position throughout the exercise.
Step 3
Slide your arms out from your sides forming a 45-degree angle with your torso, keeping your upper arms making contact with the mat / floor. Bend your elbows to a comfortable position and keep your wrists in a neutral position (aligning the backs of your forearms, wrists and hands).
Step 4
Upward Movement: Exhale and gently rotate your upper arms, sliding the mat / floor to an end position where your hands touch overhead and your elbows have a comfortable bend. Attempt to keep much of the back of your upper arms, forearms, wrists and hands in contact with, or near the mat/ floor and avoid arching your lower back as your rotate overhead.
Step 5
Downward Movement: Inhale and gently rotate your arms back to your starting position, attempting to keep your upper arms, forearms, wrists and hands in contact with, or near the mat/ floor and avoid arching your lower back as your rotate overhead.
This exercise stretches the muscles of your shoulders and lats in a stable and isolated manner. Reducing movement restriction in the shoulder helps minimize the likelihood of shoulder injury and pain. Try performing this exercise adjacent to a mirror that will allow you to monitor any undesired movement in the hips, ribs, shoulder or low-back.

Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) over the top of a properly-inflated stability ball (one that compresses approximately 6"" under your body weight) with both feet and hands on the floor, hip- and shoulder-width apart.
Step 2
Gently contract your abdominal/core muscles to stiffen your torso and slowly walk yourself backwards until your stomach lies directly over the top of the ball with both legs extended and both feet firmly placed on the floor, hip-width or wider apart. Your head, torso and legs should be in parallel alignment with your arms resting on the ball.
Step 3
Place your hands to the sides of the ball close to the top, positioning your hands directly under your shoulders and elbows by your side. Think about trying to squeeze the ball between your hands to create more strength and stability.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press your body upwards until your elbows are fully extended, but not locked. Maintain your head, torso and leg alignment, and elbows by your sides. Hold this position briefly.
Step 5
Downward Phase: Inhale and gently lower yourself to your starting position.
Step 6
Exercise Variation (1): If this body position proves too difficult in pressing upwards or in stabilizing your torso, take yourself down to a kneeling position, aligning your head, torso and thighs throughout the exercise.
Step 7
Exercise Variation (2) : To increase the balance challenge, this exercise can be performed by bringing your feet together behind you and raising one foot off the floor.
Avoid hyperextension in your low back by allowing your low bag to sag towards the floor. Your torso and hips should remain rigid and in parallel throughout the exercise.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs extended so that your hips and shoulder are aligned vertically with the floor and your spine and head are in alignment (head resting on the mat or upon a small pillow or rolled-up towel). Bend your upper leg to create a 90-degree bend at both the hip and knee, resting the inside of that knee upon the mat or upon a raised platform, (e.g., rolled-up towel, block, etc.). Extend both arms out directly in front you at chest level, overlapping your fingers together.  

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine in a neutral position and maintain this throughout the exercise. Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk and upper arm until your belly button faces the ceiling and your upper arm extends out to the side, either touching or being elevated slightly above the floor. 
Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, evidenced by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate.  Placement of a raised platform under the inside of the upper knee will help control this hip rotation.  Additionally, avoid any arching in your low back that may accompany the rotation. Stiffening (""bracing"") your abdominal muscles will help prevent this.   

Step 3
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.  Hold this position briefly, then flex (bend) the elbow of the lower arm so that the back of the arm rests against the floor / mat, while the forearm is aligned vertically to the floor.   Extend the other arm vertically towards the ceiling, but do not allow the scapula to move (i.e., hold it in the depressed and retracted position). 

Step 4
Gently exhale and while stabilizing your scapulae (shoulder blades), trunk and hips, perform a series of push-pull movements with your arms:
(a) Press the lower arm upwards, extending the elbow without allowing the scapula to move forward
(b) Pull the upper arm downwards towards the chest, flexing (bending) the elbow without allowing the scapula to move backwards.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: The exercise intensity can be increased by using dumbbells.
 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stabilize the scapulae, trunk and hips and control movement at the shoulders.  Follow the instructions provided carefully.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place one hand on the top of medicine ball and the other on the floor. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart. Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing""). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your torso to rotate, your low back or hips to sag or pitch upwards. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thighs) to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back or hips to sag or hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
As the ball adds instability to this exercise, your movements need to be slow and controlled to reduce the chance of injury.

Continue pressing until your elbows are fully extended, but not locked.  Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position, allowing your elbows to flex (bend) in a slow, controlled manner, moving the handles back towards your upper chest, stopping when they lightly touch, or are close to, your upper chest. Repeat the movement.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity and involve additional muscles, perform the following variations:
(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) presses
(b) Sit upright off the backrest, which will require a greater effort to stabilize your trunk as you perform the press movement.
 

Because a cable movement allows more freedom in the movement, it is important that you concentrate to control the speed, range and direction of movement during this exercise.

Very frequently individuals will press the bar to a point where the shoulder blades round themselves forward and move off the backrest. This promotes instability within the muscles that hold the shoulder blades to the ribcage. While this ""push-plus"" movement is considered an advanced movement, focus initially on pressing while keeping your shoulder blades flat and firmly positioned against the backrest.

An alternative position is to turn your hands to face forwards and keep your your elbows close to your sides during the downward phase. This shifts the emphasis from the chest muscles onto the triceps and may reduce stresses in the shoulder joint.
Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms on the sides of a medicine ball. Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing""). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during the downward phase. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
Step 4
An alternate ball with handles can be substituted that reduces the pressure on your wrists. When using this type of ball, maintain a neutral wrist position throughout the exercise.
As the ball adds instability to this exercise, your movements need to be slow and controlled to reduce the chance of injury.

Before you begin make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, (let the partner feel the medicine ball first so he or she knows how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it) or be sure that you have a solid wall or medicine ball rebounder that can withstand the forces of impact from a medicine ball.  
Starting Position: Stand on the floor in an athletic ready position with both feet hip-width apart, position your body directly facing your partner (or wall / rebounder), your should be at least 5-8 feet away from your partner and each partner should maintain the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest lifted up, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).   Firmly hold a medicine ball between both hands right in front of your chest; contract and brace the abdominals and keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes.  Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target. 
 
Step 2
The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, the hips slightly flexed, the abdominals engaged and both hands held straight in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball.  The person throwing the ball should step forward with the right foot into a forward lunge, as the right foot hits the ground bend your left knee to allow you to sink into your right hip simultaneously push the medicine ball away from your chest to throw it directly to your partner. 
Step 3
The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of his or her body, as the medicine ball hits the hands, allow it to decelerate towards the chest.  Once the catching partner catches the medicine ball he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge to throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw who should be standing with the hips flexed, both feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of his or her body to prepare to catch the ball.  
Step 4
The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched hands prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge. 
Step 5
The partner catching the ball should first catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement.  Perform a number of lunge and throws stepping with one leg before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward with the other leg.
Step 6
Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge. 
 

During the entire thowing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner's hands to ensure good aim).

Starting Position: Grasp two dumbbells and lie supine (on your back) on a flat bench with your feet placed firmly on the floor or upon a raised platform to allow you to maintain a neutral (flat to normal) spine. If working with a spotter, signal the spotter for assistance in handing you the dumbbells.
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) to make firm contact with the bench. Your head, shoulders, butt and feet should make contact with the bench and floor/riser throughout the exercise. Signal the spotter for assistance in moving to the starting position. Grasp each dumbbell with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward, thumbs wrapped around the handle), pressing the dumbbells to a position shoulder-width apart with your elbows extended. Externally rotate the arms (rotate your elbows to face outward and palms to face inward), slightly flexing the elbows, but maintaining a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion/extension at the wrist joint).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in unison in a wide arc until they lie level with your shoulders or chest. Keep the dumbbells parallel with each other during the movement. Maintain your slightly flexed elbows, neutral wrist position and contact of your head, shoulder, butt and feet with the bench and floor/riser.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells upward in a wide arc back to your starting position, keeping the elbows slightly flexed, wrists neutral and making contact with the head, shoulders, butt and feet with the bench and floor/riser.
Safety is very important in this exercise. A spotter should adopt a split-stance position or half-kneeling position with the hands positioned as close to the most distal (wrist) joint. Keep the hands near, but not touching the wrists unless needed.

Starting Position:  From a standing position with your feet together or slightly apart, stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.   

Step 2
Gently exhale and bend forward from your hips (""hip hinging""), keeping your knees extended (but not locked), and extend your arms in front of your body while slowly lowering your torso towards the floor until you can place your fingers or palms of your hands on the floor in front of your body.  Maintaining a flat spine and a soft bend in your knees during this movement is acceptable.

Step 3
Slowly begin to walk your hands forward (6-12” or 12 ½ - 25 cm steps) without moving your feet (your heels will begin to rise off the floor).  Continue walking yourself forward until you reach a full-push-up position where your spine, hips and head are level with the floor (plank position).

Step 4
Perform one full push-up, lowering your chest and hips simultaneously to the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase.  Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.   

Step 5
Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms fully extend at the elbows.  Slowly begin walking your feet forward towards your hands, taking 6-12” steps without moving your hands.  Maintain a flat spine throughout and continue walking until your feet are close to your hands.  

Step 6
Repeat this movement and continue for 10 – 15 yards (9-13 m).

Step 7
Exercise Variation:  You can progress this exercise by adding multiple push-ups in the lowered position.

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to monitor the position of your spine throughout the exercise.  Focus on keeping your spine flat and avoid any rounding of your low back.  Smaller steps help maintain correct body position.  Reaching too far forward with your arms will put unnecessary stress on the shoulders.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body).
 
Step 2
Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your hands facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders.
 
Step 3
Gently stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoiding any sagging or arching.
 
Step 4
Upward (Cat) Phase: Gently exhale and contract your abdominal muscles, pushing your spine upwards towards the ceiling and hold this position for 10 - 15 seconds. Allow your head to fall towards your chest, maintaining alignment with the spine.
 
Step 5
Downward (Cow) Phase: Slowly relax and yield to the effects of gravity. Let your stomach fall towards the floor (increasing the arch in your low back) and allow your shoulder blades to fall together (move towards the spine). Hold this position for 10 - 15 seconds before returning to your starting position

Keep a strong grip to maintain balance of the kettlebell. Push the right foot into the ground to shift the weight of the body forward while pressing the right arm straight overhead. Pull the right elbow back down to the rib cage to lower the weight.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you.
 
Step 2
Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body from the knees without any bend at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"").
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
Push-ups place stress upon the wrist joints. To alleviate some of this stress you may opt to use dumbbells and grip the handles rather than place your hands on the floor. If your are pressing from an elevation such as a dumbbell, you do not need to lower your chest or chin to the floor, but rather lower yourself until your chest or chin are level with the dumbbell handles.
