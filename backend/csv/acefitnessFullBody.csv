Starting Position:  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Inhale.

Step 2
Exhale and take a larger step forward with your right foot while raising your arms to the ceiling, palms facing each other. Keep your right foot pointed forward and turn your left foot out to the side 45 to 60 degrees. Align your left heel with your right.  Begin lunging forward into the right leg while keeping your back (left) leg extended.  Do not allow the right knee to extend past the right toes. Keep the back (left) heel in contact with the ground. Slowly drop your hips and rotate your torso to the right squaring your shoulders and hips to the front of the matt. Support your weight by pushing through your left foot and reach through your arms up lifting your ribcage away from the pelvis. 

Step 3
Hold this position for 3-5 slow, deep breaths (approximately 20-30 seconds) and repeat on the other side.

Starting Position: Holding the TRX handles in each hand, turn to face the anchor point. Position your feet together and hold the handles slightly above, or at shoulder-height, but at shoulder-width or slightly wider. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"").
Step 2
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly step to the left while keeping your weight over your heels, feet facing forward and using the TRX to help you maintain your balance. As you step, begin to raise both hands to an overhead position, preventing any excessive arching in your low back by depressing and retracting your scapulae (pulling your shoulders down and back) and contracting your abdominal muscles.
Step 3
Once your left foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight towards your left foot. Continue shifting your weight over the left foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your left knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your left foot. Your right leg should be near, or at full extension at the knee while keeping the right foot flat and your body weight should be shifted over to the left hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Your arms should be in a wide, overhead position.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and push off firmly with your left leg, while pulling on the TRX, returning your body to your starting position. Repeat the movement to the opposite side.
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it does necessitate additional attention to proper form.

Starting Position: Begin in a three-point stance with the hips flexed, knees bent, right foot back, the left foot forward, the right hand should be placed on the ground and the left arm in full shoulder extension (the forward motion of the arm driving forward helps with acceleration). 
Step 2
Drive the left arm forward and the right arm backwards while picking up the right leg and driving the left leg in to the ground to use left leg triple extension (plantar flexion in the ankle combined with extension of the knee and hip) to create rapid acceleration by pushing off against the ground.
Step 3
Continue with a rapid forward run focusing on maintaining explosive arm drive combined with explosive leg drive creating triple extension.
Step 4
When approaching the center cone, drop the weight back into the hips (creating hip flexion) while maintaining a tall trunk with a straight spine to while placing the feet out in front of your center of mass to decelerate your forward momentum; use the left arm to touch the cone and ensure that you are in an athletic ready position and low enough with your hips to create explosive hip drive to move laterally to the next cone.
Step 5
Plant the right foot into the ground while simultaneously picking of the left foot to move to the left; when the right foot is on the ground in hip extension and the left foot is in the air to begin the movement to the left side, the left arm should be back in shoulder extension and the right arm forward in shoulder flexion.
Step 6
Pushing off the right foot, shuffle to the left towards the cone placed approximately 5 yards to the left of the center cone;  both feet should remain parallel and your body should maintain the athletic ready position with your weight back in your hips during the lateral shuffling motion. 
Step 7
At the left cone reach down with your left hand to touch the cone (this reach will ensure that you drop back into your hips); once you have touched the cone, drive the left foot into the ground and pick up the right foot to begin the lateral shuffling movement back to the right.
Step 8
Maintain the athletic ready position with your weight back in your hips, your chest lifted tall with a straight spine and as you are shuffling to the right continue to pick up the right foot while driving off the left foot to maintain the momentum back to the cone placed 10 yards away (the right cone should be 5 yards from the center cone).
Step 9
At the right cone reach down with the right hand to touch the cone, then drive the right foot into the ground and pick up the left foot in order to laterally shuffle back to the center cone; once at the center cone, drop back into the athletic ready position with the hips flexed and spine straight and tall and push the legs forward to move backwards in a backpedaling motion to return to the original starting position. 
Exercise Variation: Have a partner or coach stand at the center cone and provide either verbal or visual instructions on which way to shuffle: either point to the left to have the athlete/client shuffle to the left, or provide a verbal cue of left to have the client/athlete move to the left.  
Focus on staying low with a straight spine and flexed hips, this will ensure the ability to maintain balance and control through the entire drill.  The center cone should be approx. 10 yards from the initial starting cone, each side cone should be 5 yards from the center cone; the total distance of the drill should cover 40 yards; but the distance between the cones can be adjusted to make the drill more (longer distances) or less (shorter distances) challenging.

Assume a ½ kneeling position with your right leg forward, left leg back, and your torso, right tibia (shinbone) and left upper thigh approximately vertical to the floor.  Move your left arm into the forward position with fingers level with your chin, and your right arm into the back position.  Squeeze both arms to your sides with approximately a 90-degree bend in each elbow, fingers extended and wrists in the neutral position (wrists aligned with your forearms).  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.  Align your head with your thoracic (upper) spine.

Step 2
Upward Movement: Exhale and explode upwards pushing from your glutes performing the following sequence:

Driving your left knee forward and upward (allow the knee-bend to open up slightly).
Driving your left arm backwards from your shoulders, while maintaining the 90-degree bend in your elbow and arm squeezed against your side. 
Driving your right arm forward from your shoulders, until fingers are level with your chin (maintaining an approximate 90-degree bend in your elbow or less) and arm squeezed against your side. 


Step 3
Continue driving forward until your right leg (stance or support) leg moves into triple extension (extending your hip, straightening your knee and exploding onto your toes).  In this position, your body should be aligned vertical or in a slight forward-lean position with your head facing forward, aligned with your spine.  Attempt to hold this end position briefly, before returning slowly to your starting position.  Perform 5 – 10 repetitions and repeat with the opposite leg.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: This dynamic movement can be progressed by holding the triple extension phase for up to 5 seconds or holding a resistance cable or band in the forward hand to pull backwards.  Perform the movement using a slow, controlled tempo (pace), to master your technique then build towards a more explosive movement.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you.
Step 2
Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"") and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase, contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to create stability for your core. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or be allowed to flare outwards slightly.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. As your press upwards, extend your left hip to lift your left foot off the floor, keeping the knee extended. Attempt to avoid rotation in your hip as you raise the left leg off the floor. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows and your left leg is extended off the floor. Hold this position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat with your opposite leg
Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and holding a medicine ball in both hands directly in front of your chest; grasp the ball with your hands in a neutral position (palms facing each other), and elbows fully flexed (bent) and facing down towards the floor. 
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) and engage your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and support your spine. Maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and reach the medicine ball back between your legs to prepare to bring it up overhead in a rapid motion.  
 
Step 3
Upward phase: Swing the medicine ball upwards over your head while reaching it back behind your head and neck and simultaneously straightening your legs and rolling up on the balls of your toes to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension); lean back while pushing the hips forward to lengthen the abdominal muscles, keep the abdominals contracted and engaged (bracing) throughout the movement to ensure spinal stability.  
Step 4
Explosively bring the ball down over your head to throw it directly downwards into the floor while dropping your weight back into your hips.  As you throw the ball down, make sure you are maintaining the abdominal bracing and hinge from the hips to maintain spinal stability.
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Use a bouncing medicine ball to throw it straight down and have the ball bounce back up into your hands to perform continuous repetitions. 
If using a bouncing medicine ball make sure that you have ample space for safety; if you are using a non-bouncing medicine ball (a ""dead"" ball) make sure you are on a solid, stable floor that can support the force of the weight being thrown explosively into the floor.

Starting Position: Make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, let the partner feel the medicine ball first so they know how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it.  Position your body directly facing your partner with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor.  Stand with the feet hip-width apart, the left foot slightly forward, the right foot slightly back while holding a medicine ball between both hands; contract and brace the abdominals while depressing and retracting your shoulder blades.  Your eyes should be looking directly at the target in order to properly aim the throw. 
Step 2
Keep your feet pressed into the ground, continue to contract and brace your abdominal  muscles, swing your arms upwards to lift the medicine ball overhead and bend your elbows to reach the medicine ball behind your head.  As you lift the ball over your head, shift your weight back into your right leg and lean back to engage the core muscles for extra power for the throw.  While preparing to throw the ball aim the throw by keeping your eyes on your partners hands as you pull the ball back over your head.
 
Step 3
Explosively step forward with the right leg and quickly bring your arms forward over your head to generate power for throwing the ball.  While stepping forward with the right leg, push the left leg into the ground create triple extension (ankle plantar flexion with knee and hip extension) and generate more forward momentum for the ball. 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: Repeating throws: Use a wall with a medicine ball capable of bouncing and position yourself so that you can throw the ball into the wall and quickly catch it to prepare for the next throw. 
The purpose of this exercise is to generate upper body power, use a ball that is no more than 10% of your bodyweight to ensure that you can acheive the appropriate velocity for the throw.

Starting Position: Stand to the left of the ladder with the feet approximately hip width apart.
Step 2
Drop into an athletic ready position with the hips flexed and the straight, tall spine; drive the left foot into the ground while picking up the right foot, (with the left foot on the floor and the right leg in the air the right arm should be back in shoulder extension and the left arm forward in shoulder flexion).  Move the right foot to the right in order to plant it inside the agility ladder to begin the lateral and forward movements for the drill.  The right foot should be planted inside the ladder, once the right foot is planted inside the ladder the left foot is brought in to the ladder and placed next to the right.
Step 3
Keep the left foot planted inside the ladder and pick up the right foot to move it to the outside of the ladder, the right foot should be planted to the side and forward of the square where the left foot remains (the movement of the drill requires a zig-zag pattern which requires both lateral and forward movement). 
Step 4
Close-up: the left foot is on the outside of the ladder to push-off and the right foot is moved forward and to the right so that it can be placed and planted inside the ladder; when the right foot hits the ground, drop back into an athletic ready position and prepare to pick up the left foot to move it inside the ladder to place it next to the right.
Step 5
Close-up: both feet are planted inside the ladder, maintain an athletic ready position with the hips flexed, spine straight and tall and the eyes looking straight ahead (not pictured).
Step 6
Close-up: when both feet are next to each other in the square, pick up the right foot and plant it on the outside of the ladder in order to push off with right foot and pick up the left foot to move it forward to the next square in the ladder.  The drill should create a zig-zag pattern which is a combination of both forward and lateral movement; the foot pattern is: in-in-out-in-in-out (right foot in the square-left foot in the square-right foot outside the square with the left foot picked up and moved forward to the next square, when it is on the ground the right foot is picked up from the outside of the square and brought into the square next to the left; the left foot is then planted on the outside of the square and the right foot moved forward to the next square).  
Step 7
Exercise Variation: When learning the drill, you can plant just one foot on the outside of the ladder, as you improve your skill and speed, you can bring both feet outside the ladder-plant the right foot, then bring the left foot outside the ladder to hit the ground next to the right before being moved to the next forward square.  Another variation is to keep your eyes off of your feet and looking straight ahead where your opponent would be during an athletic competition. 

Keep your hips flexed with a tall, straight spine to ensure the athletic position throughout the entire range-of-motion of the drill.

Before you begin make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, (let the partner feel the medicine ball first so he or she knows how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it) or be sure that you have a solid wall or medicine ball rebounder that can withstand the forces of impact from a medicine ball.  
Starting Position: Stand on the floor in an athletic ready position with both feet hip-width apart, position your body directly facing your partner (or wall / rebounder), your should be at least 5-8 feet away from your partner and each partner should maintain the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest lifted up, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).   Firmly hold a medicine ball between both hands right in front of your chest; contract and brace the abdominals and keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes.  Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target. 
 
Step 2
The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, the hips slightly flexed, the abdominals engaged and both hands held straight in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball.  The person throwing the ball should step forward with the right foot into a forward lunge, as the right foot hits the ground bend your left knee to allow you to sink into your right hip simultaneously push the medicine ball away from your chest to throw it directly to your partner. 
Step 3
The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of his or her body, as the medicine ball hits the hands, allow it to decelerate towards the chest.  Once the catching partner catches the medicine ball he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge to throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw who should be standing with the hips flexed, both feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of his or her body to prepare to catch the ball.  
Step 4
The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched hands prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge. 
Step 5
The partner catching the ball should first catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement.  Perform a number of lunge and throws stepping with one leg before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward with the other leg.
Step 6
Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge. 
 

During the entire thowing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner's hands to ensure good aim).

Starting Position: Stand with your feet together. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Hold a light-to-moderate weight medicine ball in front of your chest with both hands firmly holding on to the ball. 

Step 2
Step forward slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg.  Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and press the left (stance / supporting) foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (forward) leg with the foot placed firmly on the floor, think about lowering yourself into your hips by allowing your weight to shift downwards towards the floor instead of forward. As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (supporting) foot. While simultaneously lowering yourself into your right leg and hip, lift your hands holding the medicine ball straight overhead while continuing to maintain the abdominal bracing.

Step 3
While in the bottom (downward) phase of the lunge, pull the medicine ball back down towards your chest, continue to maintain a stiff core and drive your right foot into the ground to extend the right knee and straighten the leg to return to the original (starting) position of standing with both feet under the hips and the ball held in front of the chest.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time. 

Step 4
Exercise Variation: Begin with a light-weight medicine ball in order to learn how to maintain stability all of the way through the movement.  To increase the level of difficulty and to improve core and shoulder strength, once you can perform 8-12 repetitions on each leg, increase the weight of the medicine ball.  Another option is to hold one dumbbell in each hand, start with the elbows bent at ninety degrees and tucked in to the side, at the bottom of the lunge, bend the elbows to bring the weight up to the shoulders and press it directly overhead.

Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilize your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg and avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body by maintaining the abdominal bracing.  Keep the left (stance/supporting) foot pressed firmly into the ground, hold this position momentarily before stepping forward with the right foot. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading/forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower yourself into the right leg, maintain a straight spine by leaning forward from the hips and lower your right elbow on the inside of your right knee. 
 
Step 3
As you lower yourself into the lunge, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Place both hands on the floor with the right slightly forward of the left and continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean.  While in the lowered position with both hands on the floor, push back through the left foot to extend the left hip and maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the pelvis stable and increase the stretch to the left hip flexor.

Step 4
From the lowered position, keep your abdominals braced and push your hands into the floor to begin to raise yourself back to a standing position.  Press the right (forward) foot into the ground and drive the right knee backwards to create knee and hip extension and pull yourself forward into a standing position.  Keep your chest lifted and abdominals braced to maintain a straight spine and level pelvis while beginning to swing the left leg forward to initiate the next repetition and stretch in to the right hip.  
 
Step 5
Continue the exercise for a specific number of repetitions or over a certain distance of travel.

Step 6
Exercise Variation: to add a stretch for the hamstrings before stepping in to the next lunge, push off of the floor with your hands, lean back and push the right foot in to the ground to straighten the right leg while shifting your weight into your left hip and stretch the right hamstrings.  Alternate with both legs.
 
Focus on maintaining the abdominal bracing through the entire range-of-motion of the movement to keep the spine stable and pelvis level.

Starting Position: Stand to the side of the hurdles so that they are lying to your left, your feet should be hip-width apart with the knees slightly bent.  Bend your hips and drop into an athletic ready position so that your knees are slightly bent and your chest is directly over your toes.  Your arms should be bent with the elbows fixed at approximately ninety degrees (during the drill ensure that the swinging is coming from the shoulder joint and not from the elbows).  Shift your bodyweight so that your weight is in your right leg.  Pick the left foot up so the left hip is at ninety degrees and prepare to place the left foot on the ground beween the first two hurdles while pushing the right foot in to the ground to move your body to your left.  Maintain an abdominal contraction and straight spine during this drill and keep your feet parallel so your toes are pointed straight ahead (in the same direction that you are facing).
 
Step 2
When your left foot hits the ground, shift your bodyweight into your left leg, pick up the right foot to the point where the right hip is approximately ninety degrees, lift the foot over the hurdle and bring it to the ground next to the left foot.
 
Step 3
Explosively push your right foot into the ground and pick up the left foot until the point where the left hip achieves approximately ninety degrees of flexion and continue running over the hurdles allowing both feet to touch the space in between each individual hurdle.
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: Once you have run over the hurdles moving to your right, change directions and run over the hurdles moving to your left.  Once you establish the rythym and pace of the movement, keep your head and eyes raised so that you are looking straight ahead where your opponent would be during an athletic competition.
Make sure to land softly as you step between the hurdles, land on the ball of the foot and roll down to the heel and keep your weight back in your hips and you run through the drill.

Starting position: Stand with feet hip-width apart. In this position, gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back while keeping your arms hanging comfortably along your side.
Step 2
Keep the right foot planted on the ground, (maintain balance through the movement by pressing the right foot into the ground while extending the leg and squeezing (contracting) both the thigh and glute muscles), lift the left knee so that it is straight in front of the hip and the hip is at a ninety degree angle.  Bend the arms at ninety degree angles, as you raise the left knee, swing the right arm forward to flex the right shoulder while swinging left arm back to create shoulder extension.
Step 3
Maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the core stiff and the spine straight, lean forward on the right hip while simultaneously extending the left hip behind your body, at the same time reach forward with the right arm to create right shoulder flexion and move the left elbow back to create left shoulder extension.  Keep the right foot firmly planted into the ground to maintain balance and stability.
Step 4
Continue flexing forward on the right hip (continue squeezing the right thigh and glutes to help maintain stability) while reaching forward with the left arm and extending the right leg backwards (into hip extension).  To help maintain balance, find a spot on the floor and fix your gaze on that spot, this will create additional stability.
Step 5
At the point where you feel your end range-of-motion while balanced on your right leg, reach forward with the left arm to fully extend the elbow while flexing the shoulder at the same time extend the left leg straight back to create full hip extension.  Point the toes of the left foot towards the wall behind you in order to move into full extension of the left hip (and concurrent flexion of the right hip); continue to maintain abdominal bracing to ensure balance and stability.  Try to keep the hips level and do not let the left hip drop towards the floor or roll away from the right (planted) leg.  Hold this position for 3-5 seconds.
Step 6
Maintain abdominal bracing and begin to lean back into the right hip while pulling the left hip forward (back into flexion) and the left arm back down towards your midsection.  Return to an upright, standing position and repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time.  Alternate legs and repeat for the same number of repetitions or period of time.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: To add resistance and increase the level of difficulty, hold a dumbbell in your left hand (the weight should be in the hand opposite of the standing (balance) leg).
 

If balancing on the right leg, use the left leg to help move into a position of flexion on the right hip; pointing the left leg backwards while pointing the toes and straightening the legs will help move the right hip into a position of flexion.

Starting Position:  From a standing position with your feet together or slightly apart, stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.   

Step 2
Gently exhale and bend forward from your hips (""hip hinging""), keeping your knees extended (but not locked), and extend your arms in front of your body while slowly lowering your torso towards the floor until you can place your fingers or palms of your hands on the floor in front of your body.  Maintaining a flat spine and a soft bend in your knees during this movement is acceptable.

Step 3
Slowly begin to walk your hands forward (6-12” or 12 ½ - 25 cm steps) without moving your feet (your heels will begin to rise off the floor).  Continue walking yourself forward until you reach a full-push-up position where your spine, hips and head are level with the floor (plank position).

Step 4
Perform one full push-up, lowering your chest and hips simultaneously to the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase.  Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.   

Step 5
Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms fully extend at the elbows.  Slowly begin walking your feet forward towards your hands, taking 6-12” steps without moving your hands.  Maintain a flat spine throughout and continue walking until your feet are close to your hands.  

Step 6
Repeat this movement and continue for 10 – 15 yards (9-13 m).

Step 7
Exercise Variation:  You can progress this exercise by adding multiple push-ups in the lowered position.

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to monitor the position of your spine throughout the exercise.  Focus on keeping your spine flat and avoid any rounding of your low back.  Smaller steps help maintain correct body position.  Reaching too far forward with your arms will put unnecessary stress on the shoulders.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/207/hexagon-drill/","Step 1
Starting Position: Set up six cones in a hexagon, making each segment about 2 feet long.  Each cone should be about 2-3 feet from the center point allowing enough room for you to take a large step.  Stand in the middle of the hexagon in line with a cone.  This will be your starting point.  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up.  Shift your weight over your heels.

Step 2
Ready Position:  Maintaining abdominal bracing, bend the knees and hinge at the hips (shift hips back) bringing the torso forward.  Allow the arms to flex (bend) at the elbow and remain close to your sides.  Shift your weight to the balls of your feet.

Step 3
Action:  With the left leg, take a large step forward toward the cone into a lunge while simultaneously driving and extending the right arm forward and down, palms facing in, to the lightly touch the top of the come.  Drive your left elbow backwards.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center.

Step 4
Moving counter clockwise to the next cone (left front rotational), rotate to the left, pivoting off your right foot and lunging with your left leg aligning your feet and hips in the direction you are stepping (toward the cone). Follow the same technique as listed in step 3.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center. 

Step 5
Continue counter clock-wise until you reach your starting point.  Repeat the drill lunging forward with your right foot and moving clock-wise.

Step 6
Exercise Variations:  (1) Perform this drill extending the same side arm toward the cone.  In this case, the opposite elbow would drive back behind the body.  (2) Once you become comfortable with the oblique angle lunges, you can focus more on exploding to the cone.  To increase the amount of explosion, widen the hexagon allowing you to take a couple steps forward then lunge to touch each cone.  Placing a cone in the middle will provide a reference point. 
 

It would be beneficial to practice the directional movements with stepping first to make sure your hip and foot alignment is correct before moving to the lunge. You may also have to adjust the size of the hexagon to a distance appropriate for you to perform the exercise correctly. Keep your arm movements strong and controlled.

As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe.
 
Step 5
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding.
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent excess arching in the back with this correction.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart at the end of the ladder so it is directly in front of you.
 
Step 2
Push off with your left leg exploding into triple extension (foot is plantar-flexed, knee and hip are extended) while picking up the right leg to step into the next square.
 
Step 3
Push your left leg into triple extension (think about pushing the ground away from you) explosively drive the right knee straight up while maintaining a tall, straight spine; when the right knee is raised, the left arm should be forward in shoulder flexion and the right arm should be back in shoulder extension.
 
Step 4
Plant the right foot in the next square forward, explosively drive the right foot into the ground to create triple extension with the right leg while explosively lifting the left knee up towards the chest; maintain a tall, straight spine while explosively driving the arms into shoulder flexion and extension to help maintain the forward momentum. 
 
Step 5
Bring the left foot down and place it in the next square forward and explode into triple extension with the left leg while driving the right knee straight up; continue running forward down the ladder placing one foot in each square and emphasizing explosive leg action to rapidly move into triple extension each time you are pushing off and moving forward; keep your chest lifted, your spine straight and tall and use explosive arm swings to help maintain forward momentum through the course of the ladder.
  
Step 6
Exercise Variation:   Instead of placing one foot in each square, increase the leg action to place two feet in each square; maintain rapid arm action swinging the arms forward from the shoulder joint. 

Focus on explosive actions with your legs and pick the knees up rapidly--the faster you pick your knees up, the faster and more explosive you can move your leg into triple extension to drive your momentum forward.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hi-width apart, depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and extend your arms to reach directly behind you while keeping the elbows straight.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode forward and upwards through your lower extremity while throwing your arms overhead to achieve triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet next to each other.
 
Step 4
While in the air traveling forward pull your legs in front of you while keeping your feet next to each other in order to prepare for the landing.  Your head should be level with your eyes looking to the spot on the floor where you want to land.
 
Step 5
Your legs should be in front of you with the feet parallel next to each other, bend the knees and flex the hips to prepare to absorb the impact forces of the landing.  Keep your eyes on the floor to prepare for the landing.
 
Step 6
Landing phase: Keep your feet parallel next to each other and attempt to land softly on the whole foot, let the balls of the feet hit the ground first and quickly roll down to your heels while sinking your weight back into your heels and hips.  Use the rapid bending of the hips and knees to absorb the impact forces of the landing, do not land with a straight or hyper-extended knee as this could create an injury.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: Perform multiple jumps in a row, minimize the amount of time on the ground, as soon as you land and absorb the forces in the legs and hips explode off the ground into the next jump.
Your body will follow your eyes so be sure to look to the spot on the floor where you want to land and keep your legs and hips soft, ready to absorb the impact forces upon landing.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly lift yourself into a push-up position, shifting your hands until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles to prevent any arching in your low back or hiking of your hips towards the ceiling.

Starting Position: Place the end of a standard barbell in a corner so that it will not move unnecessarily, place a weight on one end of the barbell with a collar so that the weight can not fall off during the exercise.  Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, your toes pointed forward or slightly outward facing the end of the barbell so that it is between both feet and directly under your center of gravity.
 
Step 2
Squat down by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees, as you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward.  Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar). Position the end of the bar directly in front of your chest directly under your chin. Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward.
 
Step 3
Upward phase:  Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest.  Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position.
 
Step 4
As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
 
Step 5
As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension).
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise.
Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance. 


Technique is very important in this lift. Do not progress to explosive movements until you master your technique.

Starting Position: Stand directly in a square at one end of the ladder with your feet approximately hip-width apart.
 
Step 2
Bend your hips and drop into an athletic ready position so that your knees are slightly bent and your chest is directly over your toes.  Your arms should be bent with the elbows fixed at approximately ninety degrees (during the drill ensure that the swinging is coming from the shoulder joint and not from the elbows).
 
Step 3
Shift your bodyweight so that your weight is in your left leg.  Pick up the right foot and place it in the square next to the starting square while pushing the left foot in to the ground to move your body to your right and in to the next square of the ladder.
 
Step 4
Your right foot should hit the ground at the ball of the foot and roll all the way down to the heel, as the entire right foot hits the ground shift your body weight off of the left leg and place your weight on the right leg.  Once your bodyweight is on your right leg pick up your left foot to bring it into the same square as the right foot.  Keep your hips flexed and knees bent so that you maintain an athletic ready position throughout the length of the entire ladder.
 
Step 5
Continue to move down the ladder to your right; keep the bodyweight in the left leg while picking up the right foot to move it to the next square to the right; as the right foot hits the square, push off with the left foot and keep the bodyweight centered on top of the right leg.  Be sure to move both ways through the ladder; once you've done a certain number of repetitions to the right, be sure to switch directions and do the same number of repetitions moving to your left (pushing off of the right foot).  
 
Exercise Variation: As you improve your movement skills, dynamic balance and ability to move rapidly through the ladder, try not to look at your feet and keep your eyes on the horizon (where your opponents will be during an athletic competition).
