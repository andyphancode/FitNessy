Starting Position:  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Inhale.

Step 2
Exhale and take a larger step forward with your right foot while raising your arms to the ceiling, palms facing each other. Keep your right foot pointed forward and turn your left foot out to the side 45 to 60 degrees. Align your left heel with your right.  Begin lunging forward into the right leg while keeping your back (left) leg extended.  Do not allow the right knee to extend past the right toes. Keep the back (left) heel in contact with the ground. Slowly drop your hips and rotate your torso to the right squaring your shoulders and hips to the front of the matt. Support your weight by pushing through your left foot and reach through your arms up lifting your ribcage away from the pelvis. 

Step 3
Hold this position for 3-5 slow, deep breaths (approximately 20-30 seconds) and repeat on the other side.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/139/walking-lunges-with-twists/","Step 1
Starting Position: Stand with your feet about hip width apart. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.  Hold a medicine ball in front of your mid-section with a firm grip by both hands.
Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg. Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and keep the left (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (stance / supporting) foot. 
Step 3
As you lunge forward, focus more on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your left knee towards the heel of your right foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your left while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section. 
Step 4
From the lowered position, rotate back to the right so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the right foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the right knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously.  As you are pulling yourself foward with the right leg, pick the left leg off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Step 5
While balancing on the right leg, step forward with the left foot off the floor, stabilize your body by maintaining the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body.  Keep the right (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the left (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the left leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the  right (stance / supporting) foot. 
 
Step 6
As you continue into the next lunge with the left foot forward, keep the focus on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your right (back) knee towards the heel of your left (front) foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your left (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your right while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section. 
Step 7
From the lowered position, rotate back to the left so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the left foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the left knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously.  As you are pulling yourself foward with the left leg, pick the right foot off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Step 8
Continue the walking lunge with rotation for a specific number of repetitions or a certain distance.
 
Step 9
One variation is to contract the abdominals and glutes at the top of the stance phase (for example while balanced on the right leg with the left leg off of the ground) for 2-3 seconds to create a balance challenge.  Another variation is to add more resistance by holding one dumbbell in each hand with the elbows bent at 90 degrees and pressed into the sides of the abdominals.
To control the rotation of the movement, maintain a tall, straight spine and turn your head with your shoulders.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet feet hip-width apart, arms by your sides, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then  moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until you feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms along your sides where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support. 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, pull your knees up towards your chest and try to bring your heels right underneath your glute muscles; while in the air try to keep your feet level with each other and the bottoms parallel to the floor. 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.  Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impact forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries 
Exercise Variation: Perform repeating jumps, or add the knee tuck to the forward linear jump.
 
Use your arms to help create momentum and propel you up into the air; when squatting down reach your arms behind you, then when you jump swing your arms forward and up while pushing your legs in to the ground to help generate extra power.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/93/trx-reg-suspended-lunge/","Step 1
Starting Position: Stand in front of the anchor point and interlock the two TRX handles together (refer to TRX user instructions). Loop the foot cradle around the ball of your right foot while supporting yourself. Slowly turn to face away from the anchor point, standing on your stance leg, aligned in front, but directly in line with the anchor point. Your suspended foot should be dorsiflexed at the ankle (toes pulled towards your shin).
Step 2
Adopt a modified sprinter-stance with the right leg flexed to 90 degrees, knees aligned side by side, and the left arm flexed to 90 degrees at the elbow with the finger tips level with or just below your chin. Your right arm should also be flexed to 90 degrees, driving it back from the shoulder until the upper arm lies approximately 45 degrees from vertical.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower your body towards the floor, shifting the hips backwards simultaneously and maintaining your body weight over the heel of your left foot. As your body lowers, the suspended leg will drive backwards, maintaining the 90 degree bend at the knee. Your right arm should drive forward from the shoulder towards the a end-position where the left arm started. Your left arm should simultaneously drive backwards to an end-position where the right arm started. Throughout the arm movements, squeeze the arms to the sides of your body and drive from the shoulders while maintaining the 90 degree bends. Continue to lower yourself maintaining weight over your left heel until your right thigh and torso are in parallel (form a straight line together). Your left tibia (shinbone) should move level with or slightly ahead of the ball of your left foot.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press your body upwards by pushing down against the floor through your left heel. The muscle action at the knee and hips extend the body back to your starting position.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): To increase the exercise intensity move more explosively to triple extension. The upward phase should be performed more explosively and incorporating triple extension (at the ankle, knee and hip).
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2): To increase the exercise intensity move the upper extremity into different planes. While the lower extremity moves in the sagittal plane (front and back), the upper extremity and/or arms can move in the frontal (left and right) and transverse plane (rotation).
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it does necessitate additional attention to proper form.

Starting Position: Place your feet securely in the foot cradles positioned directly under the TRX anchor point. Apply downward pressure with your heels by dorsiflexing your ankles (toes point towards your shins) Gently lie back on a mat / floor with your arms at your sides and palms flat on the ground. Contract your core and glute muscles to lift your hips off the mat / floor keeping your body aligned and rigid, using your hands to help stabilize your body. Slowly contract your hamstrings to move your heels towards your hips while keeping your ankles in dorsiflexion. The hips should move into flexion (bending in the hips), but your torso should remain rigid with your weight bearing on your shoulders. Keep you feet together throughout the exercise.
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and press your hips towards the ceiling, extending your hips into a rigid straight line, but avoid arching your lower back. Avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly return your hips to your starting position. Avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 4
Progression: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by lengthening the straps and positioning your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX.
During this exercise, individuals often arch their back to press the hips as high as possible. This increases the stresses on the low back and should be avoided. Contracting your abdominal muscles and maintaining a neutral (flat) spine can reduce these stresses.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on a mat, placing the backs of your lower legs and heels on the top of a bench (so that the knees are able to maintain a ninety-degree bend). Position your feet hip-width apart on the bench with your ankles slightly dorsiflexed (toes pointing towards the ceiling). Gently contract your abdominal/core muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this gentle muscle contraction throughout the exercise. Extend your arms along your sides with palms turned to the ceiling and breathe deeply for 30 seconds to allow your hips to relax into this position. 
 
Step 2
Take your left foot and rotate your lower leg in towards the midline (center) of your body so that you can rest your left foot on your right knee; maintain the ninety degree bend in the left knee as the foot is resting on the right knee. 
Step 3
With both hands, reach down and grab the back of the right thigh to begin pulling your right thigh and knee towards your chest, keep the right foot on top of the bench for support as your pull your knee towards your chest.  Hold this position for 30-45 seconds, then extend the right leg back along the top of the bench before repeating 2-5 times; alternate so the right foot is resting on the left knee and repeat. 
Step 4
Exercise Variation: Instead of a bench, use a stability ball, this will allow you to roll your right knee towards your chest and use the leverage of the ball to increase the intensity of the stretch.
 
Use a bench (or stability ball) which will allow your hip and knee to remain at ninety degree angles.

This exercise is a dynamic movement exercise used to prepare the body for activity. As it involves a series of squatting movements, it is highly recommended you master your squatting technique before attempting this exercise.
Step 2
Starting Position: Stand with your feet wider than hip-width (24-36"") with your arms by your sides. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
Step 3
Movement: Drop into a wide-stance squat position (mechanics are similar to regular squat), lowering your body to a comfortable depth or until your thighs lie parallel to the floor and your body weight rests on your heels. Feel free to position your arms where they assist you in maintaining balance.
Step 4
Push upwards through the balls of your feet and into triple extension (extending the ankle, knee and hip joints) simultaneously rotating your body forward and pivoting 180-degrees your inside foot. Lift your outer leg off the ground and rotate it around to place it 24-36"" away from your pivoting foot.
Step 5
Upon placing your outer leg, firmly on the floor, drop once again into a wide-stance squat position (mechanics are similar to regular squat), lowering your body to a comfortable depth or until your thighs lie parallel to the floor and your body weight rests on your heels.
Step 6
Repeat this movement in one direction or stopping to turn back towards your starting position.
Step 7
Exercise Variation: The dynamic balance challenge to the body can be increased in this exercise by: (1) Pivoting faster without losing postural control (balance) or (2) pivoting with a backward rotation off the other foot rather than pivoting in a forward rotation.
To enjoy the benefits of this exercise, focus upon the quality of this movement. Control your movement tempo (pace) and never lose your postural control (balance).

Starting Position: Stand with your feet parallel about hip width apart while holding dumbbells in your hands with palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back). 

Attempt to avoid shrugging your shoulder upwards.
 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Slowly step to place your right foot on a platform, placing your foot firmly on the deck while keeping your torso upright and aligning your knee over your second toe. Push off with the trailing (left) leg to raise your body onto the platform placing that foot alongside your leading (right) foot. During this transition, your torso and your right tibia (shinbone) will move slightly forward past vertical, but try to avoid excessive forward movement.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly load the weight of your body into your leading (right) foot, step backwards to place the trailing (left) foot on the floor in its starting position. Allow your body to lean slightly forward during the step-down movement. Load your weight into your trailing (left) foot and step off the platform with your leading (right) foot, returning to your starting position. Repeat for the opposite side.
 
Step 4
An exercise progression is to step-up onto one leg only and remain standing on a single-leg before stepping back down.
Single-leg stepping is a functional movement we perform daily. Always monitor your foot, ankle and knee position. Avoid movement of your foot and ankle (collapsing in or out), and always attempt to keep your knee aligned over your second toe.

Starting Position:  Stand with your feet in straddle position (wider than hip-width apart) with your left foot pointing forward and your right foot pointed to the side and arms by your sides.  Line up the heel of your left foot, with your right heel.  Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and tilt your head slightly up.

Step 2
Reach your left arm straight into the air, keeping it close to your head and palm tuned in (pinky in front, thumb in back).  Keep your shoulders down, letting only the arm lift. Place your right hand lightly on your right leg. 
 
Step 3
Slowly drop your right shoulder letting your right hand move closer to your right foot.  Continue reaching up and over with your left arm as you move into lateral flexion (bending to the side). Maintain abdominal bracing and keep your head in line with your spine.  Your weight should be distributed evenly through both legs.  Maintain an open chest, keeping your right arm in line with your ear. 
 
Step 4
Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds for a total of 2-4 repetitions.  Move into the stretch a littler deeper with each repetition.  Repeat on the opposite side.
 

When sliding your hand down your leg, make sure you do not allow your hand to rest directly on your knee.  Place it above or below depending on your flexibility.  Your hand should rest lightly on the leg, not support your body weight.  Do not compromise form in order to reach your hand closer to the ground.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet approximately hip width apart. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
In preparation to step forward, slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The raised (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot.
 
Step 3
As you lower yourself forward into the lunge position, maintain the abdominal bracing and focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While in the lunge position simultaneously bend forward at your hips, while maintaining a flat back and contracting (squeezing) the glutes of the left (backward) leg, this will help increase the stretch in the left hip flexor muscles.
 
Step 4
Hold this stretch position for 15-30 seconds at a time for a total of 2-4 repetitions; try to move into the stretch a little deeper with each repetition, but be sure to keep your body in alignment.  Complete all repetitions on one side before alternating to the other leg.  Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position. 
 
At the bottom of the movement: contracting your abdominals and the glutes of the rear leg  while simultaneously lifting your chest up to the ceiling back will help increase the stretch to the back leg.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on a mat, placing the backs of your lower legs and heels on the top of a stability ball. Position your feet hip-width apart on the ball with your ankles slightly dorsiflexed (toes pointing towards the ceiling). Gently contract your abdominal/core muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this gentle muscle contraction throughout the exercise. Extend your arms out to your sides with palms turned to the floor to help stabilize your body during the exercise.
Step 2
Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and press your hips upwards off the floor into extension by contracting your glutes (butt muscles). At the same time press the backs of your lower legs and heels into the ball for additional stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back. Continue to press upwards until your legs and hips are straight with your torso and legs in alignment.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly contract your hamstrings to move your heels towards your hips while plantar flexing (toes pointed away from your shines) your ankles to rest the soles of your feet on top of the ball. Continue to pull your heels towards hips, raising your hips further off the floor. Maintain a stable torso, keeping it parallel with your upper thighs.
Step 4
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): To increase the balance challenge, move your feet closer together on the stability ball.
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2): To increase the balance challenge, move your arms towards your side or place them on your chest to reduce your stabilizing points of contact with the floor.
Step 7
Exercise Variation (3): To increase the balance challenge, raise one leg off the ball in the starting position and curl with one leg.
Avoid arching your lower back as your press your hips upward to the starting position. This can be achieved by contracting your abdominal muscles prior to lifting and keeping them engaged throughout the lift.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet feet hip-width apart, arms by your sides, depressing and retracting your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
Step 7
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can increase the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) Driving your arms behind you during the downward phase (illustrated), (2) driving your arms forward and upward during the jumping phase (illustrated), or (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phase.
It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and land before attempting to jump. Once you have mastered the hip-hinge mechanism, begin with small jumps, but emphasize your landing mechanics. Only progress to more explosive jumps once you have mastered your landing mechanics.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet feet hip-width apart, arms by your sides, depressing and retracting your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.   


Step 2
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. 


Step 3
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.  


Step 4 
Exercise Variation: Perform repeated jumps with no rest in between each repetition. 


It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and land before attempting to jump. Once you have mastered the hip-hinge mechanism, begin with small jumps, but emphasize your landing mechanics. Only progress to more explosive jumps once you have mastered your landing mechanics.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip width apart, with the right foot slightly forward (the heel of the right foot should be parallel to the toes of the left foot), your body weight should be over the right foot, only the toes of the left foot should be touching the floor to help with balance and stabilization during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise. Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine, and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back and maintain this shoulder position throughout the exercise. 
 
Step 2
Downward Movement: Inhale and press the right foot into the ground so your weight is balanced between the ball, heel and outside edge of the foot (keep the toes of the left foot on the floor for support during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise).  Slowly begin to bend forward at the hips while maintaining the abdominal bracing to avoid shifting or rotation of your torso. Maintain a flat back and head alignment with your spine (or head extended slightly upwards). 
 
Step 3
Maintain a tall spine with the abdominals braced, push your weight back into your right hip while allowing the right knee to hinge, you can either hold your arms by your side (as pictured) or hold them out front as a counter-balance.  As you are lowering yourself, maintain your weight through the ball of the foot and heel of the stance (supporting) foot, keep the pelvis level and the hips aligned during the full range-of-motion of the exercise.   
Step 4
Upward Movement: keep your bodyweight in your right leg and foot, exhale and slowly push the right foot into the ground to start moving upwards (by extending your hip and knee) to return to the initial standing position, maintain the core bracing through the entire movement to help keep the hips level and control balance.
 
Step 5
Switch the stance (supporting) leg, and complete another set of repetitions on the other leg.
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: As this technique is mastered, the exercise intensity can be progressed by (1) lifting the supporting leg off of the floor. This increases the need for balance and stabilization within the body; (2) adding external resistance by holding a dumbbell in one hand or a medicine ball in both hands; (3) bending over and / or lower the hips closer to the ground increasing your knee bend; and (4) standing on unstable surfaces (e.g., Airex pad). 
 
Keep the stance foot flat on the floor during the entire range-of-motion of the movement; to emphasize the glutes, push your weight back into your hip during the lowering phase.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet parallel facing forward and hip-width apart. Position your hands where comfortable to help you maintain your balance during the exercise. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing""). Keep your head facing slightly upwards and shift your weight onto your heels.
Step 2
Inhale and gently unload your right leg, slowly stepping to the right while keeping your weight over your heels and both feet facing forward. Once your right foot is firmly placed on the floor, bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight towards the right foot. Continue shifting your weight over the right foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your right knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your right foot. Your left leg should be near, or at full extension at the knee and your body weight should still be distributed into the right hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Keep your left foot flat on the floor as you allow your weight to shift into your right hip and alternate. Feel free to position your arms where necessary to help maintain your balance, reaching for your right foot with your left hand will emphasize hip flexion (alternate with the right hand reaching for the left foot).
Step 3
Exhale and push off firmly with your right leg, returning your body to your starting position. Repeat the movement for the opposite side.
A common mistake when performing a side lunge is that individuals often step too wide and are unable to align the tibia (shinbone) over the placed foot and the knee falls inside the foot. In this case, simply shorten the width of the step taken to allow you to align the tibia over the placed foot.

STARTING POSITION: Sit in the machine, positioning your back and sacrum (tailbone) flat against the machine's backrest. Place your feet on the resistance plate, toes pointing forward and adjust your seat and foot position so that the bend in your knees is at approximately 90 degrees with your heels flat. Lightly grasp any available handles to stabilize your upper extremity.  Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, be careful to avoid movement in your low back throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Slowly exhale while pushing the resistance plate away from your body by contracting your glutes, quadiceps and hamstrings. Keep your heels flat against the resistance plate and avoid any movement in the upper extremity.

Step 3
Continue extending your hips and knees until the knees reach a relaxed, extended position, with the heels still pressed firmly into the plate.  Do not hyperextend (lock-out) your knees and avoid lifting your butt off the seat pad or rounding out your low back.

Step 4
Pause momentarily, then slowly return to your starting position by flexing (bending) the hips and knees, and allowing the resistance plate to move towards you in a slow, controlled manner.  Do not allow your upper thighs to compress your ribcage. Repeat the movement.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: Single-leg press.
Repeat the same exercise, but use each leg independently  
 

Improper technique can lead to injury. Control the extension phase by keeping your heels in contact with the plate and avoid locking out your knees. During the return phase, control the movement and avoid compressing your upper thighs against your ribcage.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet plantar-flexed (toes pointing away from your body). Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders. Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching. 
Step 2
Maintain a strong, stable core and squeeze (contract) the left gluteus maximus (butt) to lift the left leg while maintaining your bent-knee position, allowing movement only from the left hip joint.  Perform a number of repetitions with the left leg before switching legs and performing the same number of repetitions with the right leg.
Step 3 
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the exercise, place a dumbbell in the back of the knee 
The degree of hip extension is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the leg to a height where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles.

Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"") and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase, contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to create stability for your core. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or be allowed to flare outwards slightly.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. As your press upwards, extend your left hip to lift your left foot off the floor, keeping the knee extended. Attempt to avoid rotation in your hip as you raise the left leg off the floor. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows and your left leg is extended off the floor. Hold this position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat with your opposite leg
Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.

Hinge at the hips, drop your right knee to the ground so your knee, shin, and foot are on the ground. Drag your knee forward toward the center of your arms, angling your right shin and foot across your body to the left side.

Step 3
Begin extending your back (left) leg, plantar flexing the foot so your toes are pointing away from your body.  Sink your pelvis into the ground. As your right glute moves toward the ground do not shift your weight in to the right hip.  Concentrate on shifting the left hip forward in order to keep the pelvis level.  Only extend to the point where your pelvis remains level and weight centered. Lower your chest to your top (right) leg keeping your arms in starting position extending out of the hip.  Hold this position for 15-30 seconds for a total of 2-4 repetitions on each side.

Starting Position: You and a training partner should have specialized resistance x-pattern resistance tubing with four handles so that two people can use it at the same time; or take 2 pieces of standard resistance tubing with handles and cross them to interlink them and create a 4-handled pattern (pictured).  You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; lean forward to hinge at your hips with your knees slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability.  You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) and the scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together).  You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your heads in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).  Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing each other and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull.  
Step 2
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core.  At the same time you and your partner should each pull back on the handles, the pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades (which are rectraced), use your triceps (upper arm muscles) to extend (straighten) your arms directly behind you.
Step 3
When you and your partner have each extended (straightened) your arms, you should continue to maintain spinal stability while holding the arms in a straight line and pushing against the resistance.
Step 4
You and your partner should simultaneously allow your right arm to flex (bend) slowly at the elbow working against and decelerating the pull of the resistance while holding the left arm in a straight line of elbow extension. 
Step 5
You and your partner should each simultaneously engage the upper muscles (triceps) of the right arm to push the resistance back while extending (straightening) the arm while simultaneously allowing the left arm to slowly flex (bend) at the elbow while working against the pull of the elastic resistance.  Continue alternating the action of the arms; you and your partner should each hold your right arm in extension while bending and straightening the left arm, then alternate to hold the left arm straight in extension while bending and straightening the right arm. 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the exercise, stand further away from your partner to create more resistance through the rubber resistance, or increase the speed (velocity) of the movement for enhanced power production and work-rate.

Remember to keep your feet planted into the floor with your abdominals engaged and contracted (braced) to ensure spinal stability.

Step 3
Once you and your partner have pulled the handles back (into shoulder extension) you each should hold your shoulder blades retracted in an isometric contraction.  With both arms held in an isometric contraction you and your partner should each allow your right arm to come forward in shoulder flexion (arm moving forward towards your training partner) while maintaining the left arm in a position of shoulder extension.
Step 4
Once you and your partner have each allowed your right arm to move forward and pulled it back, you each should keep the right elbow next to the body with the right shoulder held in an isometric contraction (allowing no movement) while you each reach the left arm forward (the shoulder moves into flexion).  Continue the abdominal bracing and alternate the arm movements, you and your partner should work together to provide resistance to one another while simultaneously pulling back on the bands to keep the tension.   
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Start with slow, steady consistent movements to become used to providing manual resistane through the tension of the rubber tubing; to increase the intensity you can either stand further away from each other to create additional tension on the rubber or increase the speed of the movement to make it more of a power-based exercise. 
Remember to keep your feet planted into the floor with your abdominals engaged and contracted (braced) to ensure spinal stability.

Starting Position: Two training partners should stand approximately arm's length away from one another with their feet slightly wider than hip width apart with your toes pointed forward or slightly outward.  Position your feet so that the balls of your feet align under your center of gravity. Each partner should outstretch his or her arms so they can grasp each other's forearms with their hands.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Each partner should start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight.  Each partner should maintain a firm grip and allow each other to lean back slightly in order to be able to sink deeper into the hips for a greater range-of-motion.
Step 3
Each person should continue to lower themself until their thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until their heels begin to lift off the floor, or until their torso begins to round or flex forward. Each person should monitor his or her feet, ankles and knees, to maintain control of their feet and knees each person should think about pushing the floor away from them while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as they return to a standing position. 
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe, and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: While keeping a firm grip on one another's forearms, each person should maintain a straight trunk with a head-up position, and exhale while extending the hips and knees by pushing their feet into the floor through the heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Each person should continue extending his or her hips until returning to the starting position. 
 
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Each partner can place his or her feet in a split-squat position with the feet hip width apart and one foot slightly in front of the other.  Each partner can balance on a single leg and perform a single leg squat, the act of the partners holding on to one another during the squatting movement will help to maintain the balance on one leg.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia (shinbone) forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent the excess arching in the back with this correction. If using a squat rack, the safety rungs on the rack should be positioned at mid-thigh level.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and holding a medicine ball in both hands directly in front of your chest; grasp the ball with your hands in a neutral position (palms facing each other), and elbows fully flexed (bent) and facing down towards the floor. 
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) and engage your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and support your spine. Maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and reach the medicine ball back between your legs to prepare to bring it up overhead in a rapid motion.  
 
Step 3
Upward phase: Swing the medicine ball upwards over your head while reaching it back behind your head and neck and simultaneously straightening your legs and rolling up on the balls of your toes to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension); lean back while pushing the hips forward to lengthen the abdominal muscles, keep the abdominals contracted and engaged (bracing) throughout the movement to ensure spinal stability.  
Step 4
Explosively bring the ball down over your head to throw it directly downwards into the floor while dropping your weight back into your hips.  As you throw the ball down, make sure you are maintaining the abdominal bracing and hinge from the hips to maintain spinal stability.
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Use a bouncing medicine ball to throw it straight down and have the ball bounce back up into your hands to perform continuous repetitions. 
If using a bouncing medicine ball make sure that you have ample space for safety; if you are using a non-bouncing medicine ball (a ""dead"" ball) make sure you are on a solid, stable floor that can support the force of the weight being thrown explosively into the floor.

Starting Position: Make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, let the partner feel the medicine ball first so they know how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it.  Position your body directly facing your partner with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor.  Stand with the feet hip-width apart, the left foot slightly forward, the right foot slightly back while holding a medicine ball between both hands; contract and brace the abdominals while depressing and retracting your shoulder blades.  Your eyes should be looking directly at the target in order to properly aim the throw. 
Step 2
Keep your feet pressed into the ground, continue to contract and brace your abdominal  muscles, swing your arms upwards to lift the medicine ball overhead and bend your elbows to reach the medicine ball behind your head.  As you lift the ball over your head, shift your weight back into your right leg and lean back to engage the core muscles for extra power for the throw.  While preparing to throw the ball aim the throw by keeping your eyes on your partners hands as you pull the ball back over your head.
 
Step 3
Explosively step forward with the right leg and quickly bring your arms forward over your head to generate power for throwing the ball.  While stepping forward with the right leg, push the left leg into the ground create triple extension (ankle plantar flexion with knee and hip extension) and generate more forward momentum for the ball. 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: Repeating throws: Use a wall with a medicine ball capable of bouncing and position yourself so that you can throw the ball into the wall and quickly catch it to prepare for the next throw. 
The purpose of this exercise is to generate upper body power, use a ball that is no more than 10% of your bodyweight to ensure that you can acheive the appropriate velocity for the throw.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body). Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the floor slightly in front of your shoulders, fingers pointing forwards.  Flex your left hip, bringing your left thigh to your chest, placing your left foot on the floor, heel slighlty lifted and toes pointing forward.  Lift your right knee off the ground, fully extending your right leg behind you, with your foot in dorsi flexion, (toes pointing towards your shins, heel up).  Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back)

Step 2
Keeping your hands firmly on the ground, abs engaged and shoulder strong, simultaneously switch leg positions.  Both feet leave the ground as your drive your right knee forward and extend your left leg back.  Now your left leg is fully extending behind you and your right hip is flexed with your right foot on the floor.
 
Step 3
Exercise Variation: If you have limited range of motion in the hips, place hands on a step or platform.
 

Keep your weight evenly distributed on both legs. Do not shift all your weight foward into your front foot.

Before you begin make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, (let the partner feel the medicine ball first so he or she knows how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it) or be sure that you have a solid wall or medicine ball rebounder that can withstand the forces of impact from a medicine ball.  
Starting Position: Stand on the floor in an athletic ready position with both feet hip-width apart, position your body directly facing your partner (or wall / rebounder), your should be at least 5-8 feet away from your partner and each partner should maintain the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest lifted up, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).   Firmly hold a medicine ball between both hands right in front of your chest; contract and brace the abdominals and keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes.  Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target. 
 
Step 2
The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, the hips slightly flexed, the abdominals engaged and both hands held straight in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball.  The person throwing the ball should step forward with the right foot into a forward lunge, as the right foot hits the ground bend your left knee to allow you to sink into your right hip simultaneously push the medicine ball away from your chest to throw it directly to your partner. 
Step 3
The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of his or her body, as the medicine ball hits the hands, allow it to decelerate towards the chest.  Once the catching partner catches the medicine ball he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge to throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw who should be standing with the hips flexed, both feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of his or her body to prepare to catch the ball.  
Step 4
The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched hands prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge. 
Step 5
The partner catching the ball should first catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement.  Perform a number of lunge and throws stepping with one leg before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward with the other leg.
Step 6
Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge. 
 

During the entire thowing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner's hands to ensure good aim).

Lie on your stomach on the machine, aligning the mid-point of your knee joint with the axis of rotation of the moving lever (arm) of the machine. Position the backs of the lower 1/3 of your lower legs under the resistance pads, avoiding contact with the pads at, or just above the heel.  Lightly grasp any avaiable handles to stabilize your upper extremity.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, and attempt to avoid movement in your low back throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Slowly exhale and contract your hamstrings, flexing (bending) the knees and moving the resistance pad i na controlled manner towards your butt.  Avoid arching your back during this movement.

Step 3
Continue contracting the hamstrings and moving the resistance pad until your knees are bent more than 90 degrees, or your lower legs are aligned vertical to the floor, or the pads come close to touching your butt.

Step 4
Pause momentarily, then slowly return to your starting position by lowering the resistance pads in a controlled manner. Repeat the movement.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: Repeat the same exercise, but train each leg independently.
 

Improper technique will result in excessive recruitment (use) of the lumber extensors (low back muscles).  Stabilize your low back throughout the exercise and use a lighter resistance if you are unable to control movement in the low back.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet together. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Hold a light-to-moderate weight medicine ball in front of your chest with both hands firmly holding on to the ball. 

Step 2
Step forward slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg.  Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and press the left (stance / supporting) foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (forward) leg with the foot placed firmly on the floor, think about lowering yourself into your hips by allowing your weight to shift downwards towards the floor instead of forward. As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (supporting) foot. While simultaneously lowering yourself into your right leg and hip, lift your hands holding the medicine ball straight overhead while continuing to maintain the abdominal bracing.

Step 3
While in the bottom (downward) phase of the lunge, pull the medicine ball back down towards your chest, continue to maintain a stiff core and drive your right foot into the ground to extend the right knee and straighten the leg to return to the original (starting) position of standing with both feet under the hips and the ball held in front of the chest.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time. 

Step 4
Exercise Variation: Begin with a light-weight medicine ball in order to learn how to maintain stability all of the way through the movement.  To increase the level of difficulty and to improve core and shoulder strength, once you can perform 8-12 repetitions on each leg, increase the weight of the medicine ball.  Another option is to hold one dumbbell in each hand, start with the elbows bent at ninety degrees and tucked in to the side, at the bottom of the lunge, bend the elbows to bring the weight up to the shoulders and press it directly overhead.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip width apart. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilize your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg and avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body by maintaining the abdominal bracing.  Keep the left (stance/supporting) foot pressed firmly into the ground, hold this position momentarily before stepping forward with the right foot. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading/forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower yourself into the right leg, maintain a straight spine by leaning forward from the hips and lower your right elbow on the inside of your right knee. 
 
Step 3
As you lower yourself into the lunge, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Place both hands on the floor with the right slightly forward of the left and continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean.  While in the lowered position with both hands on the floor, push back through the left foot to extend the left hip and maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the pelvis stable and increase the stretch to the left hip flexor.

Step 4
From the lowered position, keep your abdominals braced and push your hands into the floor to begin to raise yourself back to a standing position.  Press the right (forward) foot into the ground and drive the right knee backwards to create knee and hip extension and pull yourself forward into a standing position.  Keep your chest lifted and abdominals braced to maintain a straight spine and level pelvis while beginning to swing the left leg forward to initiate the next repetition and stretch in to the right hip.  
 
Step 5
Continue the exercise for a specific number of repetitions or over a certain distance of travel.

Step 6
Exercise Variation: to add a stretch for the hamstrings before stepping in to the next lunge, push off of the floor with your hands, lean back and push the right foot in to the ground to straighten the right leg while shifting your weight into your left hip and stretch the right hamstrings.  Alternate with both legs.
 
Focus on maintaining the abdominal bracing through the entire range-of-motion of the movement to keep the spine stable and pelvis level.

Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on the floor / mat in a bent-knee position, arms outstretched to your sides at shoulder level, with palms facing upwards.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.  Cross one leg over the other, resting your ankle over the opposite knee.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly press the knee of the crossed leg away from your body as illustrated without moving your hips or trunk.  This will increase the stretch in the outer thigh and hip muscles. Continue pushing your knee away from you until you reach the point of tension, avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  You may also use your hand to push the crossed knee away from you. 

Step 3
Hold this position for a moment then slowly rotate your hips towards the floor, bringing the sole of the elevated foot to rest firmly on the floor.  Avoid any rotation through your trunk or arching in your low back will performing this movement.

Step 4
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then repeat to the opposite side.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, attempt to avoid any rotation or arching in your low back.

Starting Position: Set out cones approximately 5 yards apart, stand at the far left cone in an athletic ready position: feet hip-width apart, knees bent with your weight back in your flexed hips.  Engage the abdominals (bracing) to maintain spinal stability throughout the exercise.
 
Step 2
Maintain the athletic ready position with your hips bent, your chest over your knees and your nose over your toes with your weight balanced between being up on the balls of your feet and back in your hips; shift your weight towards your right and pick up your right foot while explosively pushing your left foot into the ground to start moving to your right.
 
Step 3
Maintain the athletic ready position while continuing to move to your right, picking up the right foot and placing it to the right while pushing the left foot into the ground to generate the force and momentum for the sideways movement.  Your feet should remain parallel with one another with the toes facing foward and your weight on the balls of your feet (keep the whole foot on the ground, but your weight should be forward over the front of your feet); the emphasis of this drill should be on rapid, quick foot actions for the sideways (lateral) shuffling.
 
Step 4
At the far cone maintain the athletic ready position while shifting your weight over your left leg and push off with the right foot to begin shuffling back to the original starting point.  As you shuffle back to your left, pick up the left foot and place it to the left while pushing offer with the right foot.  Ensure that your feet remain parallel with your toes pointing forward and focus on rapid, quick foot actions for the duration of the movement.
 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Work with a coach or training partner to provide either visual cues: by signaling which direction to move with a hand gesture, e.g. pointing to the left to shuffle to the left; or verbal cues: by stating which direction to shuffle, e.g. stating ""right"" to shuffle to the right. 
Maintain a wide base of support, as you shuffle your feet should remain at least hip-width apart to maintain dynamic balance as you move over the ground.

Starting Position:  Using two stacks of risers; height not exceeding the top of your gastrocnemius (calf) muscle, place a body bar/broomstick across the top, leaving enough room between the stacks for you to step over it laterally.  Make a total of 2-4 stations, lining them up with enough room for you to do a side lunge between them.  Stand directly next to the broomstick, so it is perpendicular to your right leg.  Your feet should be hip- width apart, toes pointing forward or turned slightly outwards, with arms by your sides and elbows flexed (bent) to 90 degrees. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, and shift your weight over your heels
 
Step 2
Shift your bodyweight into your left leg and lift your right foot off of the ground and bend at the hips, pushing them backwards, while simultaneously shifting your weight to your left leg.  Maintain abdominal “bracing” and alignment. Continue loading your weight into the LEFT leg while lifting the right foot off the ground and bringing your right leg over the broomstick to hip flexion with your knee at a 90 degree angle in alignment with your hips. Your right foot should remain in dorsi-flexion (toes pulled up towards your shin) with the toes pointing forward. Place the right foot down on the opposite side of the broomstick (dowel rod) and shift your weight into your right hip to prepare to bring your left foot over the obstacle to place it next to the right. Level your hips and secure your balance.
 
Step 3
Place your right foot on the ground and bend at the hips, pushing them backwards, while simultaneously shifting your weight to your right leg.  Maintain abdominal “bracing” and alignment. Continue loading your weight into the RIGHT leg while lifting the left foot off the ground and bringing your left leg over the broomstick to hip flexion with your knee at a 90 degree angle in alignment with your hips. Your left foot should remain in dorsi-flexion (the toes pulled up towards the shin) with the toes pointing forward. Level your hips and secure your balance. Place your left foot on the ground, ending in the same body position as you started.
 
Step 4
“Unders” Continue the exercise stepping your right foot to the side, while keeping your weight over your heels and both feet facing forward step your right leg to the side. Once your right foot is firmly placed on the floor, bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight towards the right foot. Continue shifting your weight over the right foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your right knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your right foot. The goal is to sit deep into the lunge brining the glutes level with the right knee. Your left leg should be at full extension at the knee and your body weight should still be distributed into the right hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Push through your right heel and lift the left leg off the floor bringing it in to starting position.
 
Step 5
Continue into the next over/under until you reach the end.  Facing the same direction, come back down the line leading with your left foot. 
 

When stepping over the broomstick, be sure not to step too wide to avoid contacting the broomstick with the extended leg.  Contacting the broom stick a can cause it to move resulting in a loss of balance and injury.  A common mistake when performing a body weight side lunge is that individuals often step too wide and are unable to align the tibia (shinbone) over the placed foot and the knee falls inside the foot. In this case, simply shorten the width of the step taken to allow you to align the tibia over the placed foot.

Starting Position: Place a series of cones 18-24"" apart in a straight line on a non-slip surface. Stand 3-6"" to your left of the first cone with your feet hip-width apart or closer, arms by your sides. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and position your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards through your lower extremity over the top of the first cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
 
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity over the second cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 8
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward, upward (towards an overhead position) and slightly sideways in your jumping direction during the jumping phases, (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases, (4) increasing the height of each cone or the spacing between each cone, or (5) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more cones and performing a greater number of jumps in each direction.

Starting Position: Kneeling on both knees, hip-width apart, with your feet in plantar flexion (pointing backwards) and arms by your side, elongate the body reaching the head towards the ceiling.  Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, and tilt your head slightly up.
 
Step 2
Shift your weight backwards, bringing your glutes to your heels, while maintaining “bracing.” Keeping your arms close to your sides, allow your arms to move behind you, placing your fingertips lightly on the floor for support.  Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds for 2-4 repetitions.
 

Move into position slowly and controlled to avoid dropping all of your weight straight down onto your heels.  Should you have any knee discomfort, come out of the stretch position slowly and do not repeat the stretch.

Starting Position: From a kneeling position place the left knee on the floor (or stretch mat) directly under the left hip, and place the right foot in front of the right hip so that the right knee is directly over the right ankle and the right hip is in a position of ninety (90) degrees.  Place both hands gently on the right thigh to help maintain a straight, tall spine.
 
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine and keep your pelvis level (and stable).  Lean forward into your right hip while keeping your left knee pressed into the ground, do not allow your pelvis to rotate to the anterior (forward).  To increase the stretch to the left hip flexors, squeeze and contract the glute muscles of your left hip.
 
Step 3
Hold the stretch position for 30-45 seconds at a time for a total of 2-5 repetitions; try to move into the stretch a little deeper with each repetition, but be sure to keep your core braced to not allow the pelvis to rotate and lose the stretch.  Complete all repetitions on one side before alternating to the other hip.
 
Step 4  
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the stretch raise the left arm straight in the air and tilt slightly to the right side and you lean forward into the right hip; be sure to alternate sides.
Keep the abdominals engaged throughout the entire stretch, this will ensure that the pelvis remains level and will provide the greatest results from the stretch.  To reduce any soreness in the knee on the ground, place an Airex pad or a rolled-up stretch mat under the knee.

Starting Position: Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.  Extend your shoulders and reach your arms behind you to prepare the arm swing forward and upwards which will help with the upward momentum of the jump.
 
Step 2
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor as you explode your arms forward and throw them up in the air reaching overhead to help create upwards momentum away from the ground.
 
Step 3
Extend all the way through the body to create a straight line from your toes up through you arms and out of your hands.  When landing, land on the mid-foot rolling backwards towards the heels.  Push your hips backwards and downwards to absorb the impacting (ground) forces associated with landing.  Attempt to land softly and quietly and avoid locking out your knees on the landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
Exercise Variation: To increase the level of difficulty do a knee tuck and pull your knees up towards your chest as you are jumping into the air.
 
Before jumping become familiar with the movement mechanics by doing a few squats where you squat back into your heels and sink into your hips with your arms extended behind you, stand up from the squat while swinging your arms forward and roll up on your toes, then sink back into your heels; repeat for 4-6 repetitions.

Starting position: Stand with feet hip-width apart. In this position, gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back while keeping your arms hanging comfortably along your side.
Step 2
Keep the right foot planted on the ground, (maintain balance through the movement by pressing the right foot into the ground while extending the leg and squeezing (contracting) both the thigh and glute muscles), lift the left knee so that it is straight in front of the hip and the hip is at a ninety degree angle.  Bend the arms at ninety degree angles, as you raise the left knee, swing the right arm forward to flex the right shoulder while swinging left arm back to create shoulder extension.
Step 3
Maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the core stiff and the spine straight, lean forward on the right hip while simultaneously extending the left hip behind your body, at the same time reach forward with the right arm to create right shoulder flexion and move the left elbow back to create left shoulder extension.  Keep the right foot firmly planted into the ground to maintain balance and stability.
Step 4
Continue flexing forward on the right hip (continue squeezing the right thigh and glutes to help maintain stability) while reaching forward with the left arm and extending the right leg backwards (into hip extension).  To help maintain balance, find a spot on the floor and fix your gaze on that spot, this will create additional stability.
Step 5
At the point where you feel your end range-of-motion while balanced on your right leg, reach forward with the left arm to fully extend the elbow while flexing the shoulder at the same time extend the left leg straight back to create full hip extension.  Point the toes of the left foot towards the wall behind you in order to move into full extension of the left hip (and concurrent flexion of the right hip); continue to maintain abdominal bracing to ensure balance and stability.  Try to keep the hips level and do not let the left hip drop towards the floor or roll away from the right (planted) leg.  Hold this position for 3-5 seconds.
Step 6
Maintain abdominal bracing and begin to lean back into the right hip while pulling the left hip forward (back into flexion) and the left arm back down towards your midsection.  Return to an upright, standing position and repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time.  Alternate legs and repeat for the same number of repetitions or period of time.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: To add resistance and increase the level of difficulty, hold a dumbbell in your left hand (the weight should be in the hand opposite of the standing (balance) leg).
 

If balancing on the right leg, use the left leg to help move into a position of flexion on the right hip; pointing the left leg backwards while pointing the toes and straightening the legs will help move the right hip into a position of flexion.

This exercise is a dynamic movement exercise used to prepare the body for activity. As it involves a modification to a traditional push-up, it is highly recommended you master your push-up technique before attempting this exercise.
Step 2
Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward or turned slightly inward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"")and glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles), and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Rotational Movement: Exhale and gently draw one knee up towards your chest, bending the knee and flexing at the hip. Do NOT allow your hips and low back to pitch upwards or sag down towards the floor.
Step 4
In this knee-tuck position, rotate your hips to move your bent leg across the front of your torso, but avoid rotating or dropping your hips. Continue to move until your hips cannot rotate any further. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise. Pause very briefly.
Step 5
Rotate in the opposite direction (away from your torso), rotating until your hips cannot rotate any further without movement in your spine. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise.

Starting Position: While standing, position your feet shoulder-width apart, side-by-side, with your toes pointed forward or slightly outward. Take a light bar and place it behind your head grasping the end with one hand above your head and the other end with your opposite hand in the small of your back so that your hand touches your low back. Stand vertical so the bar makes contact with the back of your head, your thoracic spine (between your shoulder blades) and your sacrum (butt).
Step 2
Downward Phase: Gently exhale and begin the movement by shifting your weight onto your heels, then pushing your hips backwards towards the wall behind you and hinge forward at the hips. Move to an end position where your torso is midway between vertical and parallel to the floor allowing only slight movement (bending) at the knees throughout this movement. The bar must continue to remain in contact with the back of your head, thoracic spine and sacrum, and your lower hand must remain in contact with your low back (to prevent any arching).
Step 3
Upward Phase: Gently inhale and slowly return to your upright, standing position by contracting your glutes and pushing your hips forwards and upward. The bar must remain in contact with the three points throughout this phase.
Technique is very important in this lift. This exercise teaches the correct technique for performing a squat and is strongly encouraged as a pre-requisite to learning how to squat correctly.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/207/hexagon-drill/","Step 1
Starting Position: Set up six cones in a hexagon, making each segment about 2 feet long.  Each cone should be about 2-3 feet from the center point allowing enough room for you to take a large step.  Stand in the middle of the hexagon in line with a cone.  This will be your starting point.  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up.  Shift your weight over your heels.

Step 2
Ready Position:  Maintaining abdominal bracing, bend the knees and hinge at the hips (shift hips back) bringing the torso forward.  Allow the arms to flex (bend) at the elbow and remain close to your sides.  Shift your weight to the balls of your feet.

Step 3
Action:  With the left leg, take a large step forward toward the cone into a lunge while simultaneously driving and extending the right arm forward and down, palms facing in, to the lightly touch the top of the come.  Drive your left elbow backwards.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center.

Step 4
Moving counter clockwise to the next cone (left front rotational), rotate to the left, pivoting off your right foot and lunging with your left leg aligning your feet and hips in the direction you are stepping (toward the cone). Follow the same technique as listed in step 3.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center. 

Step 5
Continue counter clock-wise until you reach your starting point.  Repeat the drill lunging forward with your right foot and moving clock-wise.

Step 6
Exercise Variations:  (1) Perform this drill extending the same side arm toward the cone.  In this case, the opposite elbow would drive back behind the body.  (2) Once you become comfortable with the oblique angle lunges, you can focus more on exploding to the cone.  To increase the amount of explosion, widen the hexagon allowing you to take a couple steps forward then lunge to touch each cone.  Placing a cone in the middle will provide a reference point. 
 

It would be beneficial to practice the directional movements with stepping first to make sure your hip and foot alignment is correct before moving to the lunge. You may also have to adjust the size of the hexagon to a distance appropriate for you to perform the exercise correctly. Keep your arm movements strong and controlled.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or the floor in a bent-knee position with your feet flat on the floor and your arms resting comfortably along your side with the palms rotated up to face the ceiling. Start with your feet hip-width apart with the toes facing away from you, lift the left leg and place both hands on the back of the thigh to gently pull your left knee towards your chest, slide the right foot in (towards the center of the body). Gently contract your abdominal muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this abdominal stiffness throughout the exercise. 
 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and the back of your left thigh; press your right foot into the ground and lift upwards off the floor into hip extension by contracting (squeezing) your right glute (butt muscle). At the same time press your right heel into the floor for more stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back.
 
Step 3
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position by controlling the action of the right hip.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time; then alternate legs. 
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: To increase the strength of the muscles along the front of the shin (anterior tibilias) pick the toes of the right foot off of the floor to hold the foot in dorsiflexion-this is a good option for runners because it could help reduce the risk of developing shin splints.
Exhale as your push your leg into the ground, inhale on the lowering phase.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet together and your arms raised in front to shoulder height, with your elbows fully extended. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
From the same starting position, step out sideways with the right foot (both feet remain pointed forward) to the 3 o'clock position. Once the foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight over that same foot. Continue shifting your weight until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your knee is aligned directly over the second toe of that foot. Your left leg should be near, or at full extension while keeping the right foot flat. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor.
 
Step 3
While lunging, simultaneously move your arms and lean your torso in the opposite direction to the lunge movement, increasing the load on your glute muscle group. Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
 
Step 4
From the same starting position, step with one foot in front and across the body (both feet remain pointed forward). Once the foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight over that same foot. Continue shifting your weight until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your knee is aligned directly over the second toe of that foot. Your opposite leg should be flexed with the heel off the ground.
 
Step 5
While lunging, simultaneously rotate your torso and arms in the opposite direction to the lunge movement, increasing the load on your gluteal muscle group. Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
This series of multi-directional (multi-planar) lunges are intended to activate your glutes which protect your knee during walking, running and jumping-type activities. As many of us have weak glutes, this exercise can be performed as part of your pre-exercise warm-up. Given the moderate degree of complexity of the three movements, we recommend learning this exercise first without your arms and only progress to the arm drivers as you feel comfortable. It is suggested, you first learn how to perform single leg-stands on the ground and forward lunges before performing these glute activation lunges.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/22/front-squat/","Step 1
Starting Position: Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, facing outward or turned slightly outwards while holding a dumbbell in each hand by your sides, with palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Curl the dumbbells to a starting position where they rest on the front edge of your shoulders or just in front of your shoulders. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, and shift your weight over your heels.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe.
 
Step 5
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding.
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent excess arching in the back with this correction.

Starting Position: Place a series of cones 18-30"" apart in a straight line on a non-slip surface. Stand 6"" behind the first cone with your feet hip-width apart or closer, arms by your sides. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Walking Movement: Slowly lift one foot off the floor to clear the height of the cone, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward, pushing off your stance (supporting) leg to clear the cone.
 
Step 3
The raised leg should initiate contact over the cone with a heel strike first, followed by the mid- and fore-foot, transferring your body weight into that foot. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Your trailing leg needs to also clear the cone.
 
Step 4
Continue this sequence through the series of cones.
 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: This exercise can be progressed in several ways: (1) lift each leg higher off the floor (illustrated) to further challenge your balance (raising center of mass), (2) walk through the cones at a faster pace, (3) step sideways through the cones, or (4) step backwards through the cones.
 
Learn first how to perform single leg-stands on the ground and, if possible, on an Airex pad before performing cone walks.

Step 2
In preparation to step forward, slowly lift one foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The raised (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot.
 
Step 3
As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously, bend forward at your hips, maintaining a flat back and drive your extended arms towards the floor in front of you (hands should reach somewhere below your knees). This increases the load on your gluteal muscle group.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hi-width apart, depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and extend your arms to reach directly behind you while keeping the elbows straight.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode forward and upwards through your lower extremity while throwing your arms overhead to achieve triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet next to each other.
 
Step 4
While in the air traveling forward pull your legs in front of you while keeping your feet next to each other in order to prepare for the landing.  Your head should be level with your eyes looking to the spot on the floor where you want to land.
 
Step 5
Your legs should be in front of you with the feet parallel next to each other, bend the knees and flex the hips to prepare to absorb the impact forces of the landing.  Keep your eyes on the floor to prepare for the landing.
 
Step 6
Landing phase: Keep your feet parallel next to each other and attempt to land softly on the whole foot, let the balls of the feet hit the ground first and quickly roll down to your heels while sinking your weight back into your heels and hips.  Use the rapid bending of the hips and knees to absorb the impact forces of the landing, do not land with a straight or hyper-extended knee as this could create an injury.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: Perform multiple jumps in a row, minimize the amount of time on the ground, as soon as you land and absorb the forces in the legs and hips explode off the ground into the next jump.
Your body will follow your eyes so be sure to look to the spot on the floor where you want to land and keep your legs and hips soft, ready to absorb the impact forces upon landing.

Step 2
Step over the first hurdle and plant the right foot in the space between the first and second hurdles while explosively driving the left knee up to create a ninety degree angle at the left hip, at the same time the left knee is rising up swing the right arm forward moving from the shoulder joint (the movement comes from the shoulder not the elbow).
 
Step 3
Lift the left foot over the next hurdle and plant it on the ground while explosively lifting the right knee to a height where it creates ninety degrees of hip flexion, at the same time the left arm should swing forward from the shoulder while the right arm swings back into extension.  Continue running over the hurdles by picking up the knees as high as you can to ensure that you are able to clear the hurdles as you run over them.
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation:  Start with one foot touch between each pair of hurdles and progress to being able to do two foot touches in between each pair of hurdles.
 
Maintain a tall posture with straight spine by engaging the abdominals (bracing) during the drill.

As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
 
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode forward and upwards again through your lower extremity over the second cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. Continue this process until you have cleared all the cones.
 
Step 8
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward and upward (towards an overhead position) during the jumping phases, (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases, (4) increasing the height of each cone or the spacing between each cone, or (5) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more cones and performing a greater number of jumps in each direction.
Learn first how to squat and perform regular squat jumps before attempting to jump the cones.

Starting Position: Stand in an athletic ready position with your feet hip-width apart, your right leg forward, left leg back, with both arms bent at the elbows and the left arm in front of your body and right arm back behind your body.  Prepare for the jump by leaning forward hinging at the hips, while simultaneously keeping your weight back in your thighs, depressing and retracting your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Jumping Movement: Quickly sink your weight back into your hips then explosively push both feet into the floor and driving your hips forward to accelerate your body into the air achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously) in both legs. As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
 
Step 3
While you are in the air cycle your legs by moving your left leg forward in front of your body, your right leg backwards behind your body; cycle your arms with your legs so that as your left leg comes forward your right arm comes forward and as your right leg moves back your left arm moves back.
 
Step 4
Downward phase: As you land your left leg should be in front of your body and your right leg back behind your body. The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.  Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.  Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.


Step 5
Exercise Variation: Be sure to alternate the forward leg, when learning this exercise focus first on landing with control and resetting before another repetition, as you improve your strength and power progress to performing multiple jumps in a row.
 

It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and land before attempting to jump. Once you have mastered the hip-hinge mechanism, begin with small jumps, but emphasize your landing mechanics. Only progress to more explosive jumps once you have mastered your landing mechanics.

Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull the shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe. 
 
Step 5
From the Lowered Position: the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position. 
 
Think about inhaling on the way down and exhaling while exerting on the way back to the initial standing position.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body).
 
Step 2
Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders.
 
Step 3
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching.
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed.
 
Step 5
Shoulder flexion: Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement.
 
Step 6
The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles.
 
Step 7
Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs.
The bird-dog is an excellent exercise to train the body how to stabilize the lumbar spine (low back) during upper and lower extremity movement. Never exceed your body's capacity to control movement in the low back.

Starting Position: Place the end of a standard barbell in a corner so that it will not move unnecessarily, place a weight on one end of the barbell with a collar so that the weight can not fall off during the exercise.  Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, your toes pointed forward or slightly outward facing the end of the barbell so that it is between both feet and directly under your center of gravity.
 
Step 2
Squat down by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees, as you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward.  Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar). Position the end of the bar directly in front of your chest directly under your chin. Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward.
 
Step 3
Upward phase:  Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest.  Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position.
 
Step 4
As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
 
Step 5
As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension).
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise.
Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance. 


Technique is very important in this lift. Do not progress to explosive movements until you master your technique.

From the bottom of the squat, press feet into the ground and push hips forward to return to the top of the standing position.

Starting Position: Stand facing a raised platform or a plyometric jump box, place your right foot on the top of the step or box, keep your left foot on the ground, hinge from the hips to lean forward, keep your arms by your side with your right arm in shoulder extension behind you and your left arm in shoulder flexion in front of you, keep your head level with your eyes looking at a point on the ground two-to-three feet in front of you. 
Step 2
Upward phase: Jump straight up into the air by explosively pushing your right foot in to the top of the box to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension) while simultaneously pushing off with your left foot and swinging your right arm up and in front of your body to help generate upward momentum.  As you jump into the air lift up your left leg in order to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. 
Step 3
Mid-air: as you are in the air quickly swing your left leg forward and your right leg back so that you will land with your left foot on top of the platform and your right leg behind you on the floor. 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine. 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: When you are learning this exercise focus on the soft landing and reset your body in the correct position for the next jump and pause for a moment between jumps to ensure good form.  As you improve minimize the rest time so that you are rapidly moving from one jump to the next. 
 
When jumping keep your spine straight and tall by contacting your abdominals (bracing) and be sure to perform the same number of repetitions on each leg.

Starting Position: Stand directly in a square at one end of the ladder with your feet approximately hip-width apart.
 
Step 2
Bend your hips and drop into an athletic ready position so that your knees are slightly bent and your chest is directly over your toes.  Your arms should be bent with the elbows fixed at approximately ninety degrees (during the drill ensure that the swinging is coming from the shoulder joint and not from the elbows).
 
Step 3
Shift your bodyweight so that your weight is in your left leg.  Pick up the right foot and place it in the square next to the starting square while pushing the left foot in to the ground to move your body to your right and in to the next square of the ladder.
 
Step 4
Your right foot should hit the ground at the ball of the foot and roll all the way down to the heel, as the entire right foot hits the ground shift your body weight off of the left leg and place your weight on the right leg.  Once your bodyweight is on your right leg pick up your left foot to bring it into the same square as the right foot.  Keep your hips flexed and knees bent so that you maintain an athletic ready position throughout the length of the entire ladder.
 
Step 5
Continue to move down the ladder to your right; keep the bodyweight in the left leg while picking up the right foot to move it to the next square to the right; as the right foot hits the square, push off with the left foot and keep the bodyweight centered on top of the right leg.  Be sure to move both ways through the ladder; once you've done a certain number of repetitions to the right, be sure to switch directions and do the same number of repetitions moving to your left (pushing off of the right foot).  
 
Exercise Variation: As you improve your movement skills, dynamic balance and ability to move rapidly through the ladder, try not to look at your feet and keep your eyes on the horizon (where your opponents will be during an athletic competition).
