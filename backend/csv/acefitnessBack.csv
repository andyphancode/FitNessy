Starting Position:  Lie prone (on stomach) on a mat with your legs extended, toes pointing away from you, and place your hands directly under your shoulders with your fingers pointed forward and elbows positioned close to the sides of your body.  Align your head level with your thoracic (upper) spine and attempt to maintain the alignment throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and press your upper body upwards, by extending your elbows and hinge from your hips (i.e., increase the arch in your low back).  Continue moving upwards until you reach the point of tension, but avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  As you extend your elbows, your hips and upper thighs will begin to lift off the mat, but avoid lifting your knees off the floor and performing a push-up movement.  Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then slowly return downwards to your starting position and repeat the movement 2 – 4 times.

Step 3
The objective of this exercise is to extend your spine and hips, stretching the muscles on the front side of your trunk and hips, and not a strengthening exercise for your chest and arms.
 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to control your movement speed, carefully monitoring for any symptoms of pain in your spine or hips.  Be sure to differentiate the feeling of tightness from pain.

Starting Position: Holding the TRX handles or foot cradles in your right hand, turn yourself to face the anchor point. Extend (straighten) your right elbow to chest height, maintain a neutral wrist position (straight, not bent) with your thumb facing the ceiling. Retract and depress your right scapulae (pull your right shoulder down and back).
Step 2
Assume a split-stance position with the left foot forward and maintain this foot position throughout the exercise. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles (""bracing""). Gently lean backwards, shifting your body weight over your back leg while extending (straightening) your elbow, maintaining its position at chest height. Keep your wrists in a neutral position (straight, not bent) and thumb towards the ceiling. Concentrate on keeping your scapulae retracted and do not let your right shoulder roll forward. Keep your head aligned with your spine, and avoiding any sagging in the low back.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly flex (bend) your right elbow by pulling your entire body away from your arm. Your right elbow should move towards the right side of your body, your body should not rotate and your wrist should remain in the neutral position. Maintain a stiff torso with your head and spine aligned, and avoid any sagging or aching in your low back or hips.
Step 4
Downward Phase: While maintaining your rigid torso, inhale and slowly lower your body back towards your starting position, extending (straightening) your elbow without your shoulder rolling forward. Keep your head and spine aligned together.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): Change to a high-back row by raising the elbow to shoulder height during the pull movement. This places more emphasis on the posterior deltoids and muscles in the upper back.
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2) To increase the intensity of this exercise, lengthen the straps and position your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX, or change the foot position so that the ipsilateral (same side) leg is forward.
Using the TRX certainly enhances the appeal of many exercises; however, trainers and individuals should not participate in these advanced exercises until they can demonstrate capability to effectively stabilize their lumber spine (low back) with their core muscles.

Starting Position: Holding the TRX handles or foot cradles in each hand, turn yourself to face the anchor point with your feet wider than hip-width and both facing forward. Bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while maintaining your weight over your heels and using the TRX to assist you keep your balance. As your lean backwards, extend your arms forward at chest height with palms facing towards the floor. Keep your head up, looking forward throughout this movement.
Step 2
Rotation Movement: Exhale and slowly rotate your arms at the shoulders without turning your head until you reach a point of tension. The leading arm will rotate behind your torso while the trailing arm will simply move across the front of your body. Hold briefly, inhale, then exhale and rotate in the opposite direction.
Step 3
Exercise Variation (1): To progress the exercise and mimic the golf swing more closely try moving your feet together and change your starting position where you are not bending over, but assuming a slightly bent-knee (1/4 squat) position. Extend your arms forward towards your knees rather than to chest level (pushing down on the handles of foot cradles) and rotate as described above. This rotation will exhibit more pivoting off the back foot. Change your head position to look towards the floor.
Step 4
Exercise Variation (2): Progress the movement to a windmill to increase torso rotation for your golf swing. From the same starting position described in the first progression, rotate both arms together in each direction while keeping your head fixed and facing the floor. This movement will exhibit a greater degree of pivoting off the back foot.
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it requires additional attention to proper form.

Starting Position: Place your feet securely in the foot cradles positioned directly under the TRX anchor point. Apply downward pressure with your heels by dorsiflexing your ankles (toes point towards your shins) Gently lie back on a mat / floor with your arms at your sides and palms flat on the ground. Contract your core and glute muscles to lift your hips off the mat / floor keeping your body aligned and rigid, using your hands to help stabilize your body. Slowly contract your hamstrings to move your heels towards your hips while keeping your ankles in dorsiflexion. The hips should move into flexion (bending in the hips), but your torso should remain rigid with your weight bearing on your shoulders. Keep you feet together throughout the exercise.
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and press your hips towards the ceiling, extending your hips into a rigid straight line, but avoid arching your lower back. Avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly return your hips to your starting position. Avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 4
Progression: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by lengthening the straps and positioning your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX.
During this exercise, individuals often arch their back to press the hips as high as possible. This increases the stresses on the low back and should be avoided. Contracting your abdominal muscles and maintaining a neutral (flat) spine can reduce these stresses.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs bent slightly deeper than 90 degrees at the hips, knees bent to 90 degrees, and feet overlapping each other.  Align your hips and shoulder vertically with the floor and spine and head in a straight line.  Extend your lower arm in front of your body at chest level, resting it upon the mat while reaching with your upper arm down under your trunk to firmly grasp your ribcage.  Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk by pulling the ribcage around with your upper arm.  Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, (indicated by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate).  Continue rotating your trunk until your reach the point of tension, avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  The deeper bend at the hips and abdominal stiffening will help prevent any arching in your low back during the stretch.  Grasping under your ribcage will ensure rotation, and stretching of, your trunk and reduce shoulder stress that often occurs when the arm is extended and allowed to fall towards the floor (refer progression).

Step 3
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then repeat to the opposite side.

Step 4
Progression 1: Extend the lower leg, while resting the inside of the upper knee on a small riser.  In this position, the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk, evidenced by a backwards slide of the upper knee during the rotation.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips while only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.

Step 5
Progression 2: Remove the riser under the upper knee and place it firmly against the mat / floor.  In this position, the upper knee may rise off the floor and the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips by pressing the knee into the floor and only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.

Step 6
Progression 3: Repeat the same exercise, but begin with both arms extended in front of your body at chest level.  As you begin to rotate, bend the upper elbow, sliding it towards your trunk, then extending the arm outwards again at chest level as you continue your rotation.  Continue your rotation until the point of tension in the trunk and shoulder, but avoid arching your back or rotating your hips. This will increase the stretch in the shoulder and chest region, in addition to your trunk.

To maximize the benefits of this stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to follow the instructions provided carefully.

Gently contract your abdominal/core muscles to stiffen your torso and slowly walk backwards until your stomach lies directly over the top of the ball with both legs extended and both feet firmly placed on the floor, hip-width or wider apart. Your torso and legs should be in parallel alignment with your arms, resting on the ball. 

Step 3
Start with your scapulae in a retracted and depressed position (shoulders pulled down and back) without any arching in the low back while performing the formations listed in the subsequent steps. 

Step 4
""I"" Formation: Exhale, fully extend both arms and slowly raise them overhead (in line with your torso) in unison until they lie level with your torso. Your thumbs should point towards the ceiling (palms facing each other). Avoid any shrugging in your shoulders. Hold this position briefly, inhale and slowly return your arms to their starting position 

Step 5
""Y"" Formation: Exhale, fully extend both arms and slowly raise them in unison at a 45 degree angle from overhead until both lie level with your torso. Your thumbs should point towards the ceiling. Avoid any shrugging in your shoulders. Hold this position briefly, inhale and slowly return your arms to their starting position. 

Step 6
""T"" Formation: Exhale, fully extend both arms and slowly raise them out to your sides in unison at a 90 degree angle to your body until both lie parallel with your torso. Your thumbs should point towards the ceiling. Avoid any shrugging in your shoulders. Hold this position briefly, inhale and slowly return your arms to their starting position. 

Step 7
""W"" Formation: Exhale, bend your elbows, raise your arms level with your torso and push your elbows backwards towards your hips in unison. Your thumbs should point towards the ceiling. Avoid any shrugging in your shoulders. Hold this position briefly, inhale and slowly return your arms to their starting position. 

Step 8
Exercise Variation: To increase the balance challenge, this series of exercises can be progressed by bringing your feet together behind you or raising one foot off the floor. 

Avoid hyperextension in your low back by raising your torso past parallel alignment with your legs.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs extended so that your hips and shoulder are aligned vertically with the floor and your spine and head are in alignment (head resting on the mat or upon a small pillow or rolled-up towel). Bend your upper leg to create a 90-degree bend at both the hip and knee, resting the inside of that knee upon the mat or upon a raised platform, (e.g., rolled-up towel, block, etc.). Extend both arms out directly in front you at chest level, overlapping your fingers together.  

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine in a neutral position and maintain this throughout the exercise. Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk and upper arm until your belly button faces the ceiling and your upper arm extends out to the side, either touching or being elevated slightly above the floor. 
Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, evidenced by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate.  Placement of a raised platform under the inside of the upper knee will help control this hip rotation.  Additionally, avoid any arching in your low back that may accompany the rotation. Stiffening (""bracing"") your abdominal muscles will help prevent this.   

Step 3
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.  Hold this position briefly, then flex (bend) the elbow of the lower arm so that the back of the arm rests against the floor / mat, while the forearm is aligned vertically to the floor.   Extend the other arm vertically towards the ceiling, but do not allow the scapula to move (i.e., hold it in the depressed and retracted position). 

Step 4
Gently exhale and while stabilizing your scapulae (shoulder blades), trunk and hips, perform a series of push-pull movements with your arms:
(a) Press the lower arm upwards, extending the elbow without allowing the scapula to move forward
(b) Pull the upper arm downwards towards the chest, flexing (bending) the elbow without allowing the scapula to move backwards.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: The exercise intensity can be increased by using dumbbells.
 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stabilize the scapulae, trunk and hips and control movement at the shoulders.  Follow the instructions provided carefully.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward, with arms by your sides. Contract your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine while holding your chest up and out with your head tilted slightly up.

Step 2
Exhale and depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold the contraction for 5-10 seconds for a total of 2-4 repetitions. 
 
Step 3
Exercise Variations: 

Perform the exercise on one shoulder at a time. 
Isolate the two movements.  Perform scapulae depression (pull the shoulder(s) down and hold the contraction for 5-10 seconds.  Then perform scapulae retraction (pull the shoulder(s) back and hold the contraction for 5-10 seconds.  Repeat 2-4 repetitions of each exercise on both shoulders. 
This exercise can be performed in the supine position (on your back).  Starting position: Lying supine (on your back) on a matt with knees bent to 90 degrees and feet flat on the floor.  Align the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) with the knee and second toe.  Place your arms by yours side with palms facing up. Continue with the listed steps.  

 

Be sure to exhale with each contraction to help you achieve the desired range of motion.  Keep the abdominals engaged to prevent any increase in lumbar lordosis (inward curvature of the back).

Extend your arms out in front of your body and place your palms flat on the floor / mat.

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, then rotate your torso to one side, placing your hands upon the top of that thigh.  Gently exhale and slowly bend forward from your hips, reaching forward with your hands, sliding them towards your ankles.  Attempt to maintain a flat back position and avoid rounding your back towards the ceiling (make sure that you move from the hips and not your low back).  Keep your head aligned with your spine, knees extended and toes pointed upwards towards the ceiling. This should create a stretch through your inner thigh, hamstrings and side of your trunk with some stretching in your low, middle and upper back.

Continue to bend and reach forward to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times.  Repeat with the opposite leg.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, avoid any excessive rounding of your low back.

Starting Position: Adjust the seat height to a level that positions the machine handles approximately level, or near level, with your shoulders. Position your feet firmly on the floor or foot pads to stabilize your body.  Sit upright and extend your arms to grasp the handles without rounding your shoulders forward. Adjust the position the chest pad to contact your chest lightly.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the back rest. Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down), maintain a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrist in line with your forearms) and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.
 
Step 2
From this start position with your tors0 vertical, scapulae (shoulder blades) flat against your ribcage and arms extended, gently exhale and perform a pulling movement. Flex (bend) your elbows and pull them towards your chest keeping your elbows close to the sides of your body.  Continue to maintain a neutral wrist position, and contact with your chest against the chest pad.  Avoid leaning back and arching your low back and attempt to minimize any movement of your head during the movement.

Step 3
Continue pulling until your elbows pass the sides of your body. Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position, allowing your arms to move forward and elbows to extend (straighten) in a slow, controlled manner, moving the handles away from your body, stopping when your arms are fully extended. Maintain your upright trunk position and avoid forward rounding of your scapulae (shoulder blades). Repeat the movement.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity and involve additional exercises, perform the following variations:
(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) pulls
(b) Move the chest pad away from your body, which will now require a greater effort to stabilize your trunk as you perform the pulling movement.
 

Allowing your shoulders to round forward as your arms extend will allow you to pull with more force. However, learn how to perform a pulling motion without scapulae (shoulder blade) movement first before introducing shoulder movement.  Additionally, reduce unnecessary stresses into your low back by avoiding any backwards lean during the pull movements.

STARTING POSITION: Sit in the machine, anchoring your lower extremity by adjusting the thigh pad to fit firmly against the top of your thighs.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, and attempt to avoid any arching of your low back throughout the exercise.  Reach up to grasp the bar, firmly gripping the bar with both hands. While your arms are extended overhead, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.  Lean back slightly (no more than a 30 degree angle), using your legs to support your body (low back).  Maintain your head aligned with your spine.

Step 2
Slowly exhale and initiate the downward pull by first depressing (lower) your scapulae, then pulling the bar downward towards the top or mid-section of your chest. Attempt to pull in a motion that drives your elbows directly down towards the floor, bringing your elbows towards the sides of your torso. Avoid any additional backwards lean during the pull movement.

Step 3
Continue pulling until the bar nears or touches your chest, or more importantly, you observe your elbows no longer moving downward, but now beginning to move backwards.  Avoid any further pulling as this places additiomnal stresses into the shoulder joint.
 
Step 4
Pause momentarily, then slowly return to your starting position by allowing the bar to move upwards until your elbows are fully extended, then allow your scapule to rise slightly. Repeat the movement.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: Perform the exercise in a standing position with your feet in a staggered-stace (walking position).  Maintain a slight bend in your knees and shift your weight back onto your rear leg to create the backward lean. Avoid flexing (bending) forward at the hips during the pulling movement.
 

This exercise targets the major back muscles effectively, but should be performed without compromise to the shoulder or low back. Follow the instructions provided to reduce the stress placed upon these two areas.

Starting Position: Adjust the seat height to a level that positions the machine handles approximately level with your shoulders. Position your feet firmly on the floor or foot pads to stabilize your body.  Sit upright and extend your arms to grasp the handles without rounding your shoulders forward. Adjust the position the chest pad to contact your chest lightly.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, but do not press your low back into the back rest. Maintain the natural arch in your low back and avoid arching your back throughout the exercise.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down), maintain a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrist in line with your forearms) and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.

Step 2
From this start position with your torso vertical, scapulae (shoulder blades) flat against your ribcage and arms extended, gently exhale and perform a pulling movement. Flex (bend) your elbows and pull them towards your chest, but try to flair your elbows out from your sides, keeping them as level with your shoulders as possible. Continue to maintain a neutral wrist position, and contact with your chest against the chest pad.  Avoid leaning back and arching your low back and attempt to minimize any movement of your head during the movement.

Step 3
Continue pulling until your elbows reach level with, or pass just behind your shoulders. Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position, allowing the weight to pull your arms to move forward and elbows to extend (straighten) in a slow, controlled manner; the weight should straighten your arms but use your back muscles to resist the pull as the handles move away from your body, stopping when your arms are fully extended.  Maintain an upright trunk position with your spine straight and your chest lifted upwards toward the ceiling.  Do not let your spine bend forward and your back to round during this exercise.  Repeat the movement for a specific number of repetitions.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity and involve additional exercises, perform the following variations:
(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) pulls
(b) Move the chest pad away from your body, which will now require a greater effort to stabilize your trunk as you perform the pulling movement.
 

Allowing your shoulders to round forward as your arms extend will allow you to pull with more force. However, learn how to perform a pulling motion without scapulae (shoulder blade) movement first before introducing shoulder movement.  Additionally, reduce unnecessary stresses into your low back by avoiding any backwards lean during the pull movements.

Starting Position: You and a training partner should have specialized resistance x-pattern resistance tubing with four handles so that two people can use it at the same time; or take 2 pieces of standard resistance tubing with handles and cross them to interlink them and create a 4-handled pattern.  You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; your knees and hips should be slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability.  You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together).  You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).  Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing the ground and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull. 
Step 2
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core.  At the same time you and your partner should each pull back on the handles, the pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades (which are rectraced), continue holding on to the handles but think about pulling from the elbows to engage the upper back and shoulder muscles. 
Step 3
Once you and your partner have pulled the handles back (into shoulder extension) you each should hold your shoulder blades retracted in an isometric contraction.  With both arms held in an isometric contraction you and your partner should each allow your right arm to come forward in shoulder flexion (arm moving forward towards your training partner) while maintaining the left arm in a position of shoulder extension.
Step 4
Once you and your partner have each allowed your right arm to move forward and pulled it back, you each should keep the right elbow next to the body with the right shoulder held in an isometric contraction (allowing no movement) while you each reach the left arm forward (the shoulder moves into flexion).  Continue the abdominal bracing and alternate the arm movements, you and your partner should work together to provide resistance to one another while simultaneously pulling back on the bands to keep the tension.   
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Start with slow, steady consistent movements to become used to providing manual resistane through the tension of the rubber tubing; to increase the intensity you can either stand further away from each other to create additional tension on the rubber or increase the speed of the movement to make it more of a power-based exercise. 
Remember to keep your feet planted into the floor with your abdominals engaged and contracted (braced) to ensure spinal stability.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and holding a medicine ball in both hands directly in front of your chest; grasp the ball with your hands in a neutral position (palms facing each other), and elbows fully flexed (bent) and facing down towards the floor. 
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) and engage your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and support your spine. Maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and reach the medicine ball back between your legs to prepare to bring it up overhead in a rapid motion.  
 
Step 3
Upward phase: Swing the medicine ball upwards over your head while reaching it back behind your head and neck and simultaneously straightening your legs and rolling up on the balls of your toes to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension); lean back while pushing the hips forward to lengthen the abdominal muscles, keep the abdominals contracted and engaged (bracing) throughout the movement to ensure spinal stability.  
Step 4
Explosively bring the ball down over your head to throw it directly downwards into the floor while dropping your weight back into your hips.  As you throw the ball down, make sure you are maintaining the abdominal bracing and hinge from the hips to maintain spinal stability.

Before you begin make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, (let the partner feel the medicine ball first so he or she knows how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it) or be sure that you have a solid wall or medicine ball rebounder that can withstand the forces of impact from a medicine ball.  
Starting Position: Stand on the floor in an athletic ready position with both feet hip-width apart, position your body directly facing your partner (or wall / rebounder), your should be at least 5-8 feet away from your partner and each partner should maintain the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest lifted up, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).   Firmly hold a medicine ball between both hands right in front of your chest; contract and brace the abdominals and keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes.  Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target. 
 
Step 2
The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, the hips slightly flexed, the abdominals engaged and both hands held straight in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball.  The person throwing the ball should step forward with the right foot into a forward lunge, as the right foot hits the ground bend your left knee to allow you to sink into your right hip simultaneously push the medicine ball away from your chest to throw it directly to your partner. 
Step 3
The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of his or her body, as the medicine ball hits the hands, allow it to decelerate towards the chest.  Once the catching partner catches the medicine ball he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge to throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw who should be standing with the hips flexed, both feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of his or her body to prepare to catch the ball.  
Step 4
The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched hands prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge. 
Step 5
The partner catching the ball should first catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement.  Perform a number of lunge and throws stepping with one leg before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward with the other leg.
Step 6
Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge. 
 

During the entire thowing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner's hands to ensure good aim).

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet plantar-flexed (toes pointing away from your body).  Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"") to stabilize your spine and pelvis.
 
Step 2
Slowly lean forward while bending from the hips and maintaining the abdominal bracing to keep the spine straight, place your hands on the bench while keeping the arms straight with the elbows extended and position the arms so there is a straight line from the shoulders, through the elbows to the wrists.
 
Step 3
With your hands on the bench, keep your knees directly under your hips while leaning back into your hips to increase the stretch into the upper back.  Maintain the stiff core with the abdominal bracing to keep the spine straight and the pelvis level.  Keep your chin tucked into your neck to stabilize your cervical spine and to keep your head from dropping towards the floor.
 
Step 4
Hold the stretch position for approximately 30-45 seconds, to increase the stretch into the latissimus dorsi (back) muscles, slowly rotate your thumbs to point up towards the ceiling.  Repeat 2-4 times.
 
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: To increase the stretch, supinate the palms (turn the palms up to face the ceiling) while leaning back into your hips. 
 
Exhale as you lean back into your hips, and do not let your head drop towards the ground.

Starting Position: Holding two dumbbells, sit on a bench facing the backrest angled at 45 to 60 degrees. Hold your torso against the backrest and keep your feet firmly placed on the floor. Allow your arms to hang towards the floor with your elbows slightly flexed and palms facing each other. Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells up and out to the sides, raising the upper arms, elbows and dumbbells in unison until the arms are near level with the shoulders. Squeeze your scapulae (shoulder blades) together as you reach the end position. In the raised position, the dumbbells should be aligned with, or slightly in front of your ears. Avoid arching your back during the upward phase by keeping your torso firmly pressed into the backrest.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Gently inhale and lower the dumbbells in unison back to your starting position.
Technique is very important in this lift. If the dumbbells are raised to an end position behind the head rather than in line with the ears, the emphasis shifts off the shoulders and onto the latissimus dorsi (back).

Starting Position:  From a standing position with your feet together or slightly apart, stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.   

Step 2
Gently exhale and bend forward from your hips (""hip hinging""), keeping your knees extended (but not locked), and extend your arms in front of your body while slowly lowering your torso towards the floor until you can place your fingers or palms of your hands on the floor in front of your body.  Maintaining a flat spine and a soft bend in your knees during this movement is acceptable.

Step 3
Slowly begin to walk your hands forward (6-12” or 12 ½ - 25 cm steps) without moving your feet (your heels will begin to rise off the floor).  Continue walking yourself forward until you reach a full-push-up position where your spine, hips and head are level with the floor (plank position).

Step 4
Perform one full push-up, lowering your chest and hips simultaneously to the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase.  Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.   

Step 5
Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms fully extend at the elbows.  Slowly begin walking your feet forward towards your hands, taking 6-12” steps without moving your hands.  Maintain a flat spine throughout and continue walking until your feet are close to your hands.  

Step 6
Repeat this movement and continue for 10 – 15 yards (9-13 m).

Step 7
Exercise Variation:  You can progress this exercise by adding multiple push-ups in the lowered position.

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to monitor the position of your spine throughout the exercise.  Focus on keeping your spine flat and avoid any rounding of your low back.  Smaller steps help maintain correct body position.  Reaching too far forward with your arms will put unnecessary stress on the shoulders.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or the floor in a bent-knee position with your feet flat on the floor and your arms resting comfortably along your side with the palms rotated up to face the ceiling. Start with your feet hip-width apart with the toes facing away from you, lift the left leg and place both hands on the back of the thigh to gently pull your left knee towards your chest, slide the right foot in (towards the center of the body). Gently contract your abdominal muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this abdominal stiffness throughout the exercise. 
 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and the back of your left thigh; press your right foot into the ground and lift upwards off the floor into hip extension by contracting (squeezing) your right glute (butt muscle). At the same time press your right heel into the floor for more stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back.
 
Step 3
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position by controlling the action of the right hip.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time; then alternate legs. 
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: To increase the strength of the muscles along the front of the shin (anterior tibilias) pick the toes of the right foot off of the floor to hold the foot in dorsiflexion-this is a good option for runners because it could help reduce the risk of developing shin splints.
Exhale as your push your leg into the ground, inhale on the lowering phase.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/22/front-squat/","Step 1
Starting Position: Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, facing outward or turned slightly outwards while holding a dumbbell in each hand by your sides, with palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Curl the dumbbells to a starting position where they rest on the front edge of your shoulders or just in front of your shoulders. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, and shift your weight over your heels.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe.
 
Step 5
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding.
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent excess arching in the back with this correction.

Let your stomach fall towards the floor (increasing the arch in your low back) and allow your shoulder blades to fall together (move towards the spine). Hold this position for 10 - 15 seconds before returning to your starting position

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body).
 
Step 2
Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders.
 
Step 3
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching.
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed.
 
Step 5
Shoulder flexion: Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement.
 
Step 6
The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles.
 
Step 7
Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs.
The bird-dog is an excellent exercise to train the body how to stabilize the lumbar spine (low back) during upper and lower extremity movement. Never exceed your body's capacity to control movement in the low back.

Starting Position:  Stand with your feet hip-width apart with arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up.
 
Step 2
With a slight bend in the knee, shift your weight over your heels and slowly begin bending forward at the hips, maintaining the abdominal bracing and flat back.  Place your hands on the table while keeping the arms straight with the elbows extended and position the arms so there is a straight line from the shoulders, through the elbows to the wrists.  
 
Step 3
With your hands on the table, keep your legs directly under your hips while leaning back into your hips, straightening the legs and drawing your torso closer to the ground while keeping a flat back.  Keep your chin tucked into your neck to stabilize your cervical spine and to keep your head from dropping towards the floor.
 
Step 4
Hold the stretch position for 15-30 seconds for a total of 2-4 repetitions. To increase the stretch of the latissimus dorsi (back) muscles, rotate your thumbs to point toward the ceiling.
 
Step 5
Exercise Variation:  To increase the stretch, supinate the palms (turn the palms up to face the ceiling) while leaning back into your hips.
 

Exhale as you lean back into your hips.  Be sure not to fully “lock” the knees while holding this position.
