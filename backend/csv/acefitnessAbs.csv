Starting Position: Stand with your feet about hip width apart. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.  Hold a medicine ball in front of your mid-section with a firm grip by both hands.
Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg. Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and keep the left (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (stance / supporting) foot. 
Step 3
As you lunge forward, focus more on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your left knee towards the heel of your right foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your left while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section. 
Step 4
From the lowered position, rotate back to the right so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the right foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the right knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously.  As you are pulling yourself foward with the right leg, pick the left leg off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Step 5
While balancing on the right leg, step forward with the left foot off the floor, stabilize your body by maintaining the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body.  Keep the right (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the left (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the left leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the  right (stance / supporting) foot. 
 
Step 6
As you continue into the next lunge with the left foot forward, keep the focus on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your right (back) knee towards the heel of your left (front) foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your left (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your right while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section. 
Step 7
From the lowered position, rotate back to the left so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the left foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the left knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously.  As you are pulling yourself foward with the left leg, pick the right foot off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Step 8
Continue the walking lunge with rotation for a specific number of repetitions or a certain distance.
 
Step 9
One variation is to contract the abdominals and glutes at the top of the stance phase (for example while balanced on the right leg with the left leg off of the ground) for 2-3 seconds to create a balance challenge.  Another variation is to add more resistance by holding one dumbbell in each hand with the elbows bent at 90 degrees and pressed into the sides of the abdominals.
To control the rotation of the movement, maintain a tall, straight spine and turn your head with your shoulders.

Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on the floor / mat in a bent-knee position with feet placed firmly on the floor and arms at your sides.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.  Slowly lift both feet off the floor, extending your knees until your thighs are aligned vertically with the floor, and allowing your toes to point away from your body (DO NOT move your thighs beyond this point as it shifts your body weight from your butt into your low back, which increases the stress to your low back).  Position your hands on your thighs (front or side) without lifting your shoulder blades off the floor / mat.

Step 2
Gently exhale, contract your abdominals to flex (curl) your trunk, lifting your scapulae (shoulder blades) off the floor, slowly sliding your hands down your thighs towards your ankles.  Maintain your head position aligned with your thoracic (upper) spine and avoid flexing your head too far forward. This movement will press your low back into the floor / mat. 

Step 3
Continue curling upward until your scapulae (shoulder blades) lift completely off the floor and hold this up-position briefly for 5 - 10 seconds then slowly return downwards to your starting position and repeat the movement.  Complete a set of quality reps until your experience fatigue or until your technique (form) becomes compromised.
 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to control your movement speed, keep your thighs aligned vertically and roll your trunk upwards and downwards during the exercise.

Starting Position: Assume a seated bent-knee position, feet placed flat on the floor / mat and arms outstretched behind you with your palms flat on the floor / mat and fingers pointed outwards or away from your body.  Adjust your position to distribute your weight evenly between your feet, butt and arms.  Keep your back supported in a neutral or flat position (i.e., avoid arching or slumping) and your head aligned with your thoracic (upper) spine.

Step 2
Slowly lean back, bending your elbows until your trunk is supported on your elbows.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise (avoid “arching” or “slumping” your low back).  Gently exhale and slowly lift one foot off the floor, extending the knee until the leg straightens with your toes pointing away from your body.  Hold this up-position briefly for 5 – 10 seconds then slowly return to your starting position and repeat the movement with the opposite leg.  Complete a set of quality reps until your experience fatigue or until your technique (form) becomes compromised.

Step 3
Progression #1: Adjust your position by sitting-up until your trunk is at a 45-degree angle with the floor and move your hands close to your hips to support your body while keeping a slight bend in your elbows.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise (avoid “arching” or “slumping” your low back).  Repeat the same sequence outlined previously, but avoid leaning back during the leg lift.

Step 4
Progression #2: Slowly lean back, bending your elbows until your trunk is supported on your elbows.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise (avoid “arching” or “slumping” your low back).  Gently exhale and slowly lift both feet off the floor, extending the knees until both legs straighten with your toes pointing away from your body.  Hold this up-position briefly for 10 – 15 seconds then slowly return to your starting position and repeat.  Complete a set of quality reps until your experience fatigue or until your technique (form) becomes compromised.

Step 5
Progression #3: Adjust your position by sitting-up until your trunk is at a 45-degree angle with the floor and move your hands out to your sides to support your body.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise (avoid “arching” or “slumping” your low back).  Repeat the same sequence outlined previously, but avoid leaning back during the leg lifts.

Step 6
Progression #4: Assume the same starting possession as outline previously with your trunk at a 45-degree angle with the floor, but remove your hands off the floor, extending them both directly in front of you, level with your chest.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise (avoid “arching” or “slumping” your low back).  Gently exhale and slowly lift one foot off the floor, extending the knee until the leg straightens with your toes pointing away from your body.  Hold this up-position briefly for 15 – 30 seconds then slowly return to your starting position and repeat the movement with the opposite leg.  Complete a set of quality reps until your experience fatigue or until your technique (form) becomes compromised.

Starting Position:  Lie prone (on stomach) on a mat with your legs extended, toes pointing away from you, and place your hands directly under your shoulders with your fingers pointed forward and elbows positioned close to the sides of your body.  Align your head level with your thoracic (upper) spine and attempt to maintain the alignment throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and press your upper body upwards, by extending your elbows and hinge from your hips (i.e., increase the arch in your low back).  Continue moving upwards until you reach the point of tension, but avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  As you extend your elbows, your hips and upper thighs will begin to lift off the mat, but avoid lifting your knees off the floor and performing a push-up movement.  Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then slowly return downwards to your starting position and repeat the movement 2 – 4 times.

Step 3
The objective of this exercise is to extend your spine and hips, stretching the muscles on the front side of your trunk and hips, and not a strengthening exercise for your chest and arms.
 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to control your movement speed, carefully monitoring for any symptoms of pain in your spine or hips.  Be sure to differentiate the feeling of tightness from pain.

Starting Position: Place your feet securely into the foot cradles positioned directly under the anchor point. Apply downward pressure with the tops of your feet by plantarflexing your ankles (toes point away from your shins). Gently lie flat on your stomach with your hands placed shoulder-width apart, under your shoulders and facing forward. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles (""bracing""), and your glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles).
Step 2
Exhale and slowly press yourself upward until your elbows are fully extended, aligning your head and spine (avoid any sagging or aching in your low back or hips hiking upwards). Keep your feet together throughout the exercise and avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale, contract your abdominal muscles and slowly pull your legs towards your chest. Knees must remain extended knees and ankles in plantarflexion (toes pointed away from your shins). Keep you feet together throughout the exercise. During the movement your hips will rise upwards (your glutes should move towards the ceiling). Continue the movement until your hips move directly over your shoulders in an inverted shoulder press position. Maintain a rigid torso and flat spine, preventing any arching or bowing in the back.
Step 4
Downward Phase: While maintaining your rigid torso, inhale and slowly lower your body towards the starting push-up position, maintaining your head and spine alignment.
Step 5
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by lengthening the straps and positioning your body further away from the anchor point of the TRX.
Using the TRX certainly enhances the appeal of many exercises; however, trainers and individuals should not participate in these advanced exercises until they can demonstrate capability to effectively stabilize their lumber spine (low back) with their core muscles.

Starting Position: Stand in front of the anchor point and interlock the two TRX handles together (refer to TRX user instructions). Loop the foot cradle around the ball of your right foot while supporting yourself. Slowly turn to face away from the anchor point, standing on your stance leg, aligned in front, but directly in line with the anchor point. Your suspended foot should be dorsiflexed at the ankle (toes pulled towards your shin).
Step 2
Adopt a modified sprinter-stance with the right leg flexed to 90 degrees, knees aligned side by side, and the left arm flexed to 90 degrees at the elbow with the finger tips level with or just below your chin. Your right arm should also be flexed to 90 degrees, driving it back from the shoulder until the upper arm lies approximately 45 degrees from vertical.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower your body towards the floor, shifting the hips backwards simultaneously and maintaining your body weight over the heel of your left foot. As your body lowers, the suspended leg will drive backwards, maintaining the 90 degree bend at the knee. Your right arm should drive forward from the shoulder towards the a end-position where the left arm started. Your left arm should simultaneously drive backwards to an end-position where the right arm started. Throughout the arm movements, squeeze the arms to the sides of your body and drive from the shoulders while maintaining the 90 degree bends. Continue to lower yourself maintaining weight over your left heel until your right thigh and torso are in parallel (form a straight line together). Your left tibia (shinbone) should move level with or slightly ahead of the ball of your left foot.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press your body upwards by pushing down against the floor through your left heel. The muscle action at the knee and hips extend the body back to your starting position.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): To increase the exercise intensity move more explosively to triple extension. The upward phase should be performed more explosively and incorporating triple extension (at the ankle, knee and hip).
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2): To increase the exercise intensity move the upper extremity into different planes. While the lower extremity moves in the sagittal plane (front and back), the upper extremity and/or arms can move in the frontal (left and right) and transverse plane (rotation).
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it does necessitate additional attention to proper form.

Grasp the handles/cradles with a closed, pronated grip (thumbs wrapped around the handles with your palms facing the floor) and position your hips directly over your knees, keeping your legs hip-width apart. Flex (bend) your torso into a ball by contracting your abdominal muscles and maintain this position throughout the movement. Bend your elbows until your upper arms are positioned vertical to the floor with your hands adjacent to your face and keep your head aligned with the upper spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Contract your core and back muscles to further stiffen your torso in preparation for movement. Inhale and gently push your hips forward, opening up the angle at your knees as your body swings forward under the anchor point. Do not allow your spine to straighten or your back to begin arching (sagging) during the movement. Keep your elbows in and hands adjacent to your face.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly pull with your abdominal muscles until your body is back to your starting position. Be sure not to alter your arm or back position.
Using the TRX certainly enhances the appeal of many exercises; however, trainers and individuals should not participate in these advanced exercises until they can demonstrate capability to effectively stabilize their lumber spine (low back) with their core muscles.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs bent slightly deeper than 90 degrees at the hips, knees bent to 90 degrees, and feet overlapping each other.  Align your hips and shoulder vertically with the floor and spine and head in a straight line.  Extend your lower arm in front of your body at chest level, resting it upon the mat while reaching with your upper arm down under your trunk to firmly grasp your ribcage.  Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk by pulling the ribcage around with your upper arm.  Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, (indicated by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate).  Continue rotating your trunk until your reach the point of tension, avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  The deeper bend at the hips and abdominal stiffening will help prevent any arching in your low back during the stretch.  Grasping under your ribcage will ensure rotation, and stretching of, your trunk and reduce shoulder stress that often occurs when the arm is extended and allowed to fall towards the floor (refer progression).

Step 3
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then repeat to the opposite side.

Step 4
Progression 1: Extend the lower leg, while resting the inside of the upper knee on a small riser.  In this position, the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk, evidenced by a backwards slide of the upper knee during the rotation.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips while only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.

Step 5
Progression 2: Remove the riser under the upper knee and place it firmly against the mat / floor.  In this position, the upper knee may rise off the floor and the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips by pressing the knee into the floor and only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.

Step 6
Progression 3: Repeat the same exercise, but begin with both arms extended in front of your body at chest level.  As you begin to rotate, bend the upper elbow, sliding it towards your trunk, then extending the arm outwards again at chest level as you continue your rotation.  Continue your rotation until the point of tension in the trunk and shoulder, but avoid arching your back or rotating your hips. This will increase the stretch in the shoulder and chest region, in addition to your trunk.

To maximize the benefits of this stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to follow the instructions provided carefully.

Step 3
External Rotation: Gently rotate your forearms backwards towards the floor without arching your lower back or changing your wrist position. Your goal is to rotate your forearms backwards until the backs of forearms, wrists and hands all make contact with the floor and remain aligned together. Hold this position for 15-30 seconds before slowly returning to your starting position.
Step 4
Internal Rotation: Gently rotate your forearms forward towards the floor without flexing your torso (bending forward from your waist line) or raising the backs of your shoulders off the floor. Your goal is to rotate your forearms forward until the fronts of your hands are 2-4"" off the floor (20-30 degrees off the floor). Keep your forearms, wrists and hands aligned and hold this position for 15-30 seconds before slowly returning to your starting position.
This exercise stretches and strengthens your rotator cuff muscles in your shoulders in a stable and isolated manner. Healthy rotator cuff muscles permit healthy joint movements at the shoulder, reducing your likelihood of injury and pain. Try to perform this exercise adjacent to a mirror that will allow you to monitor any undesired movement in the hips, ribs, shoulder or low-back. This is a good warm-up exercise to prepare the shoulders for heavier loads during exercises like the dumbbell bench press or standing barbell shoulder press.

Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly lift one leg off the floor, moving your knee towards your trunk, while maintaining a 90-degree bend at the knee.  DO NOT extend the knee during this movement).  Continue moving until the thigh reaches or comes close to a position where it aligns vertically to the floor.  DO NOT go beyond this position.  Hold this position for 5 – 10 seconds then slowly return your leg to the floor, completing 2 – 4 repetitions and repeating with the opposite leg.

Step 3
The goal of this exercise is to control the position of your low back during leg movements.  Movement of the thigh past vertical will flatten your back, thus changing the position of your low back.  If necessary, place one hand or a rolled up towel into the small of your back to monitor for any changes in the position of your low back during the movement.

Step 4
EXERCISE VARIATION: This exercise can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the elevated position for 1 - 2 seconds.
The intensity can be progressed by incorporating simultaneous overhead unilateral (single-arm) or bilateral (both arms) movements, 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to control movement speed and monitor changes in your low back carefully.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or firm surface, bending your knees until your feet are positioned flat on the floor 12 - 18"" from your buttocks. Extend your arms out to your sides, palms facing either up or down (illustrated) at, or near shoulder level. Breathe deeply for a 30 seconds relaxing your body and allowing gravity to gently pull your lower back and shoulders towards the floor.
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulder down and back) without increasing the arch in your low back or lifting your hips off the mat / floor. Hold this position throughout the exercise.
Step 3
Hollowing Movement: Breathe normally and at the end of your breaths (end-tidal volume), perform the following actions individually at first, then combine them together:

Perform a gentle ""kegel"" contraction without moving your hips or ribcage (the kegel contraction of the pelvic floor is the same contraction your would perform when resisting the urge to urinate).
Draw your belly button towards your spine without moving your hips or rib cage (visualize narrowing your waist circumference without taking a deep breath). Any movement of the hips or rib cage indicates activation of your larger abdominal muscles (e.g. rectus abdominis).
Combining both 1 and 2 above.
Combining 1 and 2, but counting out loud while breathing normally (i.e. holding the contractions through normal breathing)

 
Step 4
Exercise Progressions: Once your have spent time learning how to co-contract the muscles of the pelvic floor and core, independent of breathing, progress the exercise complexity by adding small movements in the lower extremity:

Lift one leg 3 - 6"" (no more) off the mat and hold this position briefly (illustrated) without moving your torso (hips, shoulders or increasing your low-back arch).
Heel slide, lifting the toes in one foot off the floor and slowly sliding the heel of one foot 3-6"" away from your body. without moving your torso (hips, shoulders or increasing your low-back arch)

 
This series of exercise movements activate your core muscles that are often neglected. Good core activity (independent of your larger, more superficial abdominal muscles like your rectus abdominis) helps stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine against injury. Try performing this exercise adjacent to a mirror that will allow you to monitor any undesired movement in the hips, ribs, shoulder or low-back.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or firm surface, bending your knees until your feet are positioned flat on the floor 12 - 18"" from your buttocks. Allow your arms to lie along your side and bend the elbows so your hands are pointing towards the ceiling. Breathe deeply for a 30 seconds relaxing your body and allowing gravity to gently pull your lower back and shoulders towards the floor.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without increasing the arch in your low back or lifting your hips off the mat / floot.  Hold this position throughout the exercise.  
 
Step 2
To start the exercise, initiate a Hollowing Movement: Breathe normally and at the end of your breaths (end-tidal volume), perform the following actions individually at first, then combine them together: 

Perform a gentle ""kegel"" contraction without moving your hips or ribcage (the kegel contraction of the pelvic floor is the same contraction your would perform when resisting the urge to urinate).
Draw your belly button towards your spine without moving your hips or rib cage (visualize narrowing your waist circumference without taking a deep breath). Any movement of the hips or rib cage indicates activation of your larger abdominal muscles (e.g. rectus abdominis).
Combining both 1 and 2 above.
Combining 1 and 2, but counting out loud while breathing normally (i.e. holding the contractions through normal breathing)

 
Once you have used a hollowing movement to stabilize your spine and pelvis, lift both legs and arms off of the floor; the knees should be directly over the hip joints and bent ninety degrees (pictured) and the elbows should be directly over the shoulder joints so your hands are pointed over your head (pictured). 
 
Step 3
Inhale and maintain the abdominal hollowing while slowly lowering the right heel and left hand towards the floor.  The hand and heel should lightly touch the floor (but not rest), exhale continue the abdominal hollowing and slowly bring the leg and arm back to the initial starting position.  Alternate to use the right arm and left leg; continue to complete a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time. 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: To have more control (making it easier) when learning this exercise, start with the hands resting on the floor above the head and the feet resting gently on the floor in front of the buttocks; slowly lift the right arm and left leg off of the floor together while maintaining the abdominal hollowing, lower and alternate sides.  
Continue to breathe while holding the abdominal hollowing and bracing.

Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on the floor / mat in a bent-knee position with feet placed firmly on the floor and your arms crossed behind your head.  Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down).  Slowly lift both feet off the floor moving your knees towards your trunk until your thighs align vertically to the floor (90-degree angle at the hips).  Maintain a 90-degree bend at the knee and relax your feet, allowing them to point away from your body. 

Step 2
Gently exhale then begin your movement by simultaneously:

Drive your right knee towards your chest in a straight line and allow the knee to bend to a deeper angle.
Extend (straightening) your left leg outward while keeping it elevated off the floor.
Contract your abdominals to flex (curl) your trunk, lifting your left shoulder blade off the floor and rotating your trunk slowly to drive your left elbow towards your right knee.  This movement will press your low back into the floor / mat.   


Step 3
Continue moving until your elbow touches or comes close to touching the opposite knee.  Hold this up-position briefly for 1 – 2 seconds then slowly return to your starting position and repeat the movement to the opposite side.  Complete a set of quality reps until your experience fatigue or until your technique (form) becomes compromised.

Step 4
Important points to consider while performing this movement:

Perform this exercise in a slow, controlled manner
Do not pull forward on your head during the trunk curl.  Support your head in your hands while maintaining alignment of your head with your thoracic (upper) spine.
During the upward and downward movement of your trunk, it is important to keep your low back pressed into the floor / mat. 
The rotation should come from your trunk and not your hips.  While your legs drive forward and backwards in a straight line, your trunk will flex (curl) and rotate.

 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to control movement speed and monitor changes in your low back carefully.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/108/standing-wood-chop/","Step 1
The wood chop is a functional, yet advanced movement that needs to be learned in three stages. Stage 1: Spiral rotation of the arms Stage 2: Spiral rotation of the arms with hip rotation and flexion (bending) Stage 3: Full wood chop with spiral rotation of the arms, hip and torso, and hip flexion (bending).
Step 2
Stand in a split-stance position with your left foot forward. Hold a medicine in both hands, keeping the ball relatively close to the your body. Contract your abdominal / core muscles to stiffen your torso, holding it vertical to the floor. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulder down and back) without arching your low back
Step 3
Stage One Starting Position (illustrated): Slowly rotate your arms with the medicine ball to the left, to a starting position high and behind you, but do not rotate your head, chest or torso. Your head, chest and hips should remain facing forward at all times throughout this exercise stage. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body.
Step 4
Movement: Slowly, rotate your arms down and across your body to the right, to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned near your right hip (performing a wood chop movement). Do not rotate your head, chest, torso or hips, and keep them facing forward. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body. Hold this end position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat the movement in the opposite direction with your opposite leg forward.
Step 5
Exercise Progression: Repeat the same movement, but extend your arms at the elbow and maintain this arm position throughout the wood chop movements. This longer lever increases the loading on the spine, requiring the core muscles to work harder
Step 6
Stage Two Starting Position (not illustrated): Change your foot position to a stagger-stance by widening your base of support (moving feet wider apart). Assume the same starting position with your bent arms, but allow your hips to rotate to the left with your arms, increasing your degree of rotation. Your head, chest and torso should remain aligned over your hips. Much of your body weight should be loaded into your left leg.
Step 7
Movement: Slowly, rotate your arms down and across your body to the right, while squatting down slightly to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned lower than your your right hip (performing a wood chop movement), and much of your weight has shifted over into the right leg. Rotate your hips, but keep your head, chest and torso aligned over your hips. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body. Hold this end position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat the movement in the opposite direction with your opposite leg forward.
Step 8
Exercise Progression: Repeat the same movement, but extend your arms at the elbow and maintain this arm position throughout the wood chop movements. This longer lever increases the loading on the spine, requiring the core muscles to work harder
Step 9
Stage Three Starting Position (illustrated): Assume the same starting position as in stage two, but fully extend your elbows and allow your torso to rotate further than your hips, increasing your degree of rotation around. Shift more weight into your left foot and allow your right foot to pivot on the floor.
Step 10
Movement: Slowly, rotate your arms down and across your body to the right, while squatting down slightly to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned below your right hip (performing a wood chop movement), and much of your weight has shifted into the right leg. Your torso will rotate further and faster than your hips. Keep your elbows fully extended throughout the movement. Hold this end position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat the movement in the opposite direction with your opposite leg forward.
Engage your abdominal / core muscles throughout this exercise to stabilize and protect your spine.

Starting Position: Attach a cuff (cable or band resistance) to one ankle with the anchor or resistance point behind your body. Stand with feet hip-width apart. In this position, the band / resistance cable should be under little, to no tension. Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. 


Step 2
Slowly lift your cuffed foot 1 - 2"" off the floor while stabilizing your body on your stance (supporting leg) without shifting your hips or leaning with your torso. Hold on to a stable surface for balance as needed. 


Step 3
Slowly lift your cuffed foot 1 - 2"" off the floor while stabilizing your body on your stance (supporting leg) without shifting your hips or leaning with your torso. Hold on to a stable surface for balance as needed. 


Step 4
Continue extending your knee until your leg is straightened or you reach the limits of your comfort level. The point where you notice your hips or torso beginning to tilt backwards indicates that you have reached the limits of movement in your joint. 


Step 5
Downward Movement: Inhale and slowly return your leg back to your starting position without losing your balance or changing the position of your torso or stance (supporting) leg. 


Step 6
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be enhanced by (1) increasing your range of motion if you were unable to straighten your knee, (2) increasing the resistance in the cable / band, or (3) removing any balance assistance, or standing on an unstable surface (e.g., Airex pad, BOSU, etc.). 


The ability to perform this exercise unassisted offers the added benefit of balance training.

Place your hands behind your head, squeezing your scapulae (shoulder blades) together and pulling your elbows back without arching your low back. This elbow position should be maintained throughout the exercise. Align your head with your spine, but allow it to move into slight flexion (moving the chin towards the chest) during the upward phase of the exercise.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale, contract your abdominal and core muscles, and flex your chin slightly towards your chest while slowly curling your torso towards your thighs. Since the abdominals attach the rib cage to the pelvis, your movement should focus on pulling these two body parts closer together (the neck stays relaxed while the chin is tucked towards the neck and focus on pulling the bottom of the chest towards the top of the pelvis). Your feet should remain firmly planted, and your tailbone and lower back should remain in contact with the ball at all times. Continue curling up until your upper back is lifted off the ball. Hold this position briefly while maintaining your balance.
Step 4
Downward Phase: Gently inhale and slowly uncurl (lower) your torso back towards the ball in a controlled fashion keeping your feet firmly planted, and your tailbone and low back in contact with the ball.
Should balance prove to be a challenge, widen your base of support by moving your feet apart. As your improve your balance skills, increase the balance challenge of this exercise by reducing your base of support by moving your feet together.

Stand with both feet together or spread a few inches apart (2-3""), but parallel with each other while holding a 1-2 lb soft sponge ball or weighted medicine ball. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) while simultaneously engaging (contracting) your abdominal muscles to avoid any excessive arching in your low back. Bend your knees very slightly and keep your abductors and adductors under tension (contract your inner and outer thigh muscles). This will help avoid excessive hip adduction (sideways shift) during the single-leg stand. This exercise is best performed with a partner, but can be performed without one.
Step 2
Starting Position: Slowly lift one leg 3-6 "" off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold the ball close to your body, centered at chest height
Step 3
Movement: To do this exercise you will need to establish targets in the space around your body. You can follow a partner's cues or select your own targets. Holding the ball, reach out and extend both arms to touch the targets you've established.
Step 4
Your initial targets should be level with your chest and torso, or overhead, but positioned in front of your body so that it does not require any movement of your hips or torso.
Step 5
Exercise Variation: As you master the starting positions, increase the intensity of the exercise by (1) reaching down towards low targets that require either a forward bend in your torso or single-leg squat, or both; and (2) reaching low or high, and around to targets positioned below your waistline or above your shoulders.
Most of us can lift one leg, but the question of the quality of movement is important. Perform your movements slowly and under control, avoiding any sudden positional changes. Perform each progression until you can execute them with good control and form.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place one hand on the top of medicine ball and the other on the floor. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart. Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing""). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your torso to rotate, your low back or hips to sag or pitch upwards. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thighs) to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back or hips to sag or hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
As the ball adds instability to this exercise, your movements need to be slow and controlled to reduce the chance of injury.

Perform an equal number of repetitions with each foot.
Step 3
Exercise Variation: Increase the intensity of this exercise by going through the following progressions (1) lift the one leg higher off the floor (illustrated) to further raise your center of mass, (2)raise both arms overhead (3) lift one arm to your side, (4) tilt your head, (5) close your eyes then finally (6) close your eyes and tilt your head.
Try to perform this exercise in front of a mirror initially so that you can watch and control the degree of hip adduction (sideways shift) over the stance (supporting) leg. Always try to minimize the degree of hip adduction as it places excessive stresses on your knee joint. While balancing on the stance leg (the foot on the ground) think about pressing your foot into the floor and squeezing your glutes (butt muscles), this will help reduce any sideways tilting.

Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on a mat in a bent-knee position and place a small pillow, rolled-up towel or foam pad under your head.  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise. While holding a light dumbbell or weight in one hand, press that arm vertically while maintaining a neutral wrist (i.e., wrist aligned with your forearm) and scapula (shoulder blade) in contact with the mat.  Place your opposite arm at the side of your body.

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and maintain this throughout the exercise. Gently exhale and rotate your trunk and legs slowly towards the arm placed at your side while keeping the extended arm vertical to the floor at all times and the upper shoulder stable (i.e., no movement of the shoulder blade).  Continue to rotate until your belly button is level with the floor. This places a significant stretch and increased load into the upper shoulder.  Control movement (stabilize) in this shoulder and avoid any arching in your low back that may accompany the rotation.  Stiffening (""bracing"") your abdominal muscles will help prevent this.   

Step 3
Pause momentarily then slowly return back to your starting position.  Perform 1 set x 5 – 10 repetitions at a slow, controlled tempo (pace), then repeat to the opposite side.  

Step 4
Exercise Variation: If a light dumbbell is not available, perform this exercise without any resistance or with any weighted device. The exercise complexity is increased by holding a kettle bell that has an “offset center of mass.” 
 

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stabilize the scapula and control movement carefully.  Follow the instructions provided carefully

Starting Position: Assume a seated position with your legs apart as illustrated. The angle of your legs should not compromise your ability to sit upright (i.e., trunk vertical) with your head aligned with your spine, extend your knees and point your toes towards the ceiling. Extend your arms out in front of your body and place your palms flat on the floor / mat.

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, then rotate your torso to one side, placing your hands upon the top of that thigh.  Gently exhale and slowly bend forward from your hips, reaching forward with your hands, sliding them towards your ankles.  Attempt to maintain a flat back position and avoid rounding your back towards the ceiling (make sure that you move from the hips and not your low back).  Keep your head aligned with your spine, knees extended and toes pointed upwards towards the ceiling. This should create a stretch through your inner thigh, hamstrings and side of your trunk with some stretching in your low, middle and upper back. 

Step 3
Continue to bend and reach forward to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times.  Repeat with the opposite leg.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.

To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, avoid any excessive rounding of your low back.

Starting Position: Assume a seated position with your legs apart as illustrated. The angle of your legs should not compromise your ability to sit upright (i.e., trunk vertical) with your head aligned with your spine, extend your knees and point your toes towards the ceiling. Bend your elbows and abduct your arms (raise arms to sides) slightly so that your forearms are positioned vertically to the floor.

Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, then gently exhale and slowly bend sideways, driving the lowered elbow downward towards the floor without rotating your trunk or bending forward. Keep your head aligned with your spine, knees extended and toes pointed upwards towards the ceiling. This should create a stretch through the side of your trunk with some stretching in your back.
Step 3
Continue to bend sideways to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds then relax by returning to your starting position, repeat 2-4 times, then switch to the opposite side of your body. 

Step 4
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions in each direction, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.

Starting Position: Sit on a mat/floor with your knees bent, feet together, heels on the floor while holding a medicine ball in your lap close to your body. Start with a light ball (2 lb) and increase the weight of the ball as your fitness level improves. Sit upright with your chest raised towards the ceiling and back erect so that your torso is perpendicular to the floor. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing"").
 
Step 2
Rotation: Without leaning backwards, exhale and slowly rotate your torso and the ball to one side, keeping the ball close to your body and aligned with the middle of your torso. The ball should not drop towards the floor. Pause briefly at the end range of motion, inhale and then gently exhale while rotating completely to the opposite side. Repeat the movement back and forth.
 
Step 3
Exercise Progression 1: As your conditioning improves, you can modify your starting position by leaning back halfway to the floor while keeping your knees bent and heels on the floor. With each rotation bring the elbow close to, but not to rest on the floor. Keep your core and abdominal muscles stiff to prevent any arching in your low back during the exercise. This exercise variation increases the demands placed upon your abdominal muscles.
 
Step 4
Exercise Progression 2: As your conditioning levels continue to improve, you can modify your starting position once again by leaning back halfway to the floor and lifting your legs off the floor. Keep your knees bent and feet together during the exercise. With each rotation bring the elbow close to, but not to rest on the floor. Keep your core and abdominal muscles stiff to prevent any arching in your low back and avoid any shrugging in your shoulders during the exercise. This exercise variation further increases the demands placed upon your abdominal muscles.
Intermediate and advanced rotational exercises should only be attempted after completing the beginner exercises.

Starting Position: Lie in a supine (on your back) position on a mat with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor and arms spread out to your sides with your palms facing down. Gently exhale, stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal/core muscles (""bracing"") and slowly lift your feet off the floor, raising your knees directly above your hips while maintaining a 90 degree bend in the knees. Hold this position and breathe normally. Use your arms as a balance support.
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale, contract your abdominal, core and hip flexor muscles and slowly raise your hips off the mat, rolling your spine up as if trying to bring your knees towards your head (your hips and pelvis should move towards your rib cage). Avoid any change in the angle of your knees during the roll-up. Use your arms and hands to assist with maintaining your balance and continue to curl-up until your spine cannot roll any further. Hold this position briefly.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Gently inhale and lower your spine back towards the mat in a controlled fashion, moving your upper thighs backwards until they are positioned directly over your hips. Continue rolling out until your spine and pelvis (hips) contact the mat and your knees are positioned directly over the your hips with a 90 degree bend with your lower leg.
Proper form is important when performing this exercise to prevent excessive stresses on your low back. When returning to your starting position during the repetitions, control your leg movement ensuring that your knees don't move past your hips, but instead return to a position directly above your hips. Since the abdominals connect the rib cage to the pelvis, the emphasis of the movement should be on pulling your pelvis upwards towards your rib cage.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet plantar-flexed (toes pointing away from your body). Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders. Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching. 
Step 2
Maintain a strong, stable core and squeeze (contract) the left gluteus maximus (butt) to lift the left leg while maintaining your bent-knee position, allowing movement only from the left hip joint.  Perform a number of repetitions with the left leg before switching legs and performing the same number of repetitions with the right leg.
Step 3 
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the exercise, place a dumbbell in the back of the knee 
The degree of hip extension is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the leg to a height where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles.

Starting Position: You and a training partner should have specialized resistance x-pattern resistance tubing with four handles so that two people can use it at the same time; or take 2 pieces of standard resistance tubing with handles and cross them to interlink them and create a 4-handled pattern (pictured).  You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; lean forward to hinge at your hips with your knees slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability.  You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) and the scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together).  You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your heads in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).  Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing each other and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull.  
Step 2
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core.  At the same time you and your partner should each pull back on the handles, the pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades (which are rectraced), use your triceps (upper arm muscles) to extend (straighten) your arms directly behind you.
Step 3
When you and your partner have each extended (straightened) your arms, you should continue to maintain spinal stability while holding the arms in a straight line and pushing against the resistance.
Step 4
You and your partner should simultaneously allow your right arm to flex (bend) slowly at the elbow working against and decelerating the pull of the resistance while holding the left arm in a straight line of elbow extension. 
Step 5
You and your partner should each simultaneously engage the upper muscles (triceps) of the right arm to push the resistance back while extending (straightening) the arm while simultaneously allowing the left arm to slowly flex (bend) at the elbow while working against the pull of the elastic resistance.  Continue alternating the action of the arms; you and your partner should each hold your right arm in extension while bending and straightening the left arm, then alternate to hold the left arm straight in extension while bending and straightening the right arm. 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the exercise, stand further away from your partner to create more resistance through the rubber resistance, or increase the speed (velocity) of the movement for enhanced power production and work-rate.

Remember to keep your feet planted into the floor with your abdominals engaged and contracted (braced) to ensure spinal stability.

                View Details","https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/265/partner-assisted-bodyweight-squats/","Step 1
Starting Position: Two training partners should stand approximately arm's length away from one another with their feet slightly wider than hip width apart with your toes pointed forward or slightly outward.  Position your feet so that the balls of your feet align under your center of gravity. Each partner should outstretch his or her arms so they can grasp each other's forearms with their hands.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Each partner should start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight.  Each partner should maintain a firm grip and allow each other to lean back slightly in order to be able to sink deeper into the hips for a greater range-of-motion.
Step 3
Each person should continue to lower themself until their thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until their heels begin to lift off the floor, or until their torso begins to round or flex forward. Each person should monitor his or her feet, ankles and knees, to maintain control of their feet and knees each person should think about pushing the floor away from them while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as they return to a standing position. 
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe, and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: While keeping a firm grip on one another's forearms, each person should maintain a straight trunk with a head-up position, and exhale while extending the hips and knees by pushing their feet into the floor through the heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Each person should continue extending his or her hips until returning to the starting position. 
 
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Each partner can place his or her feet in a split-squat position with the feet hip width apart and one foot slightly in front of the other.  Each partner can balance on a single leg and perform a single leg squat, the act of the partners holding on to one another during the squatting movement will help to maintain the balance on one leg.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia (shinbone) forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent the excess arching in the back with this correction. If using a squat rack, the safety rungs on the rack should be positioned at mid-thigh level.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms on the sides of a medicine ball. Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (""bracing""). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during the downward phase. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
Step 4
An alternate ball with handles can be substituted that reduces the pressure on your wrists. When using this type of ball, maintain a neutral wrist position throughout the exercise.
As the ball adds instability to this exercise, your movements need to be slow and controlled to reduce the chance of injury.

Keep your chest lifted up, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).   Firmly hold a medicine ball between both hands right in front of your chest; contract and brace the abdominals and keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes.  Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target. 
 
Step 2
The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, the hips slightly flexed, the abdominals engaged and both hands held straight in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball.  The person throwing the ball should step forward with the right foot into a forward lunge, as the right foot hits the ground bend your left knee to allow you to sink into your right hip simultaneously push the medicine ball away from your chest to throw it directly to your partner. 
Step 3
The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of his or her body, as the medicine ball hits the hands, allow it to decelerate towards the chest.  Once the catching partner catches the medicine ball he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge to throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw who should be standing with the hips flexed, both feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of his or her body to prepare to catch the ball.  
Step 4
The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched hands prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge. 
Step 5
The partner catching the ball should first catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement.  Perform a number of lunge and throws stepping with one leg before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward with the other leg.
Step 6
Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge. 
 

During the entire thowing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner's hands to ensure good aim).

Starting Position: Stand with your feet together. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Hold a light-to-moderate weight medicine ball in front of your chest with both hands firmly holding on to the ball. 

Step 2
Step forward slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg.  Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and press the left (stance / supporting) foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (forward) leg with the foot placed firmly on the floor, think about lowering yourself into your hips by allowing your weight to shift downwards towards the floor instead of forward. As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (supporting) foot. While simultaneously lowering yourself into your right leg and hip, lift your hands holding the medicine ball straight overhead while continuing to maintain the abdominal bracing.

Step 3
While in the bottom (downward) phase of the lunge, pull the medicine ball back down towards your chest, continue to maintain a stiff core and drive your right foot into the ground to extend the right knee and straighten the leg to return to the original (starting) position of standing with both feet under the hips and the ball held in front of the chest.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time. 

Step 4
Exercise Variation: Begin with a light-weight medicine ball in order to learn how to maintain stability all of the way through the movement.  To increase the level of difficulty and to improve core and shoulder strength, once you can perform 8-12 repetitions on each leg, increase the weight of the medicine ball.  Another option is to hold one dumbbell in each hand, start with the elbows bent at ninety degrees and tucked in to the side, at the bottom of the lunge, bend the elbows to bring the weight up to the shoulders and press it directly overhead.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip width apart. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilize your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg and avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body by maintaining the abdominal bracing.  Keep the left (stance/supporting) foot pressed firmly into the ground, hold this position momentarily before stepping forward with the right foot. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading/forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower yourself into the right leg, maintain a straight spine by leaning forward from the hips and lower your right elbow on the inside of your right knee. 
 
Step 3
As you lower yourself into the lunge, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Place both hands on the floor with the right slightly forward of the left and continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean.  While in the lowered position with both hands on the floor, push back through the left foot to extend the left hip and maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the pelvis stable and increase the stretch to the left hip flexor.

Step 4
From the lowered position, keep your abdominals braced and push your hands into the floor to begin to raise yourself back to a standing position.  Press the right (forward) foot into the ground and drive the right knee backwards to create knee and hip extension and pull yourself forward into a standing position.  Keep your chest lifted and abdominals braced to maintain a straight spine and level pelvis while beginning to swing the left leg forward to initiate the next repetition and stretch in to the right hip.  
 
Step 5
Continue the exercise for a specific number of repetitions or over a certain distance of travel.

Step 6
Exercise Variation: to add a stretch for the hamstrings before stepping in to the next lunge, push off of the floor with your hands, lean back and push the right foot in to the ground to straighten the right leg while shifting your weight into your left hip and stretch the right hamstrings.  Alternate with both legs.
 
Focus on maintaining the abdominal bracing through the entire range-of-motion of the movement to keep the spine stable and pelvis level.

Starting Position:  Using two stacks of risers; height not exceeding the top of your gastrocnemius (calf) muscle, place a body bar/broomstick across the top, leaving enough room between the stacks for you to step over it laterally.  Make a total of 2-4 stations, lining them up with enough room for you to do a side lunge between them.  Stand directly next to the broomstick, so it is perpendicular to your right leg.  Your feet should be hip- width apart, toes pointing forward or turned slightly outwards, with arms by your sides and elbows flexed (bent) to 90 degrees. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, and shift your weight over your heels
 
Step 2
Shift your bodyweight into your left leg and lift your right foot off of the ground and bend at the hips, pushing them backwards, while simultaneously shifting your weight to your left leg.  Maintain abdominal “bracing” and alignment. Continue loading your weight into the LEFT leg while lifting the right foot off the ground and bringing your right leg over the broomstick to hip flexion with your knee at a 90 degree angle in alignment with your hips. Your right foot should remain in dorsi-flexion (toes pulled up towards your shin) with the toes pointing forward. Place the right foot down on the opposite side of the broomstick (dowel rod) and shift your weight into your right hip to prepare to bring your left foot over the obstacle to place it next to the right. Level your hips and secure your balance.
 
Step 3
Place your right foot on the ground and bend at the hips, pushing them backwards, while simultaneously shifting your weight to your right leg.  Maintain abdominal “bracing” and alignment. Continue loading your weight into the RIGHT leg while lifting the left foot off the ground and bringing your left leg over the broomstick to hip flexion with your knee at a 90 degree angle in alignment with your hips. Your left foot should remain in dorsi-flexion (the toes pulled up towards the shin) with the toes pointing forward. Level your hips and secure your balance. Place your left foot on the ground, ending in the same body position as you started.
 
Step 4
“Unders” Continue the exercise stepping your right foot to the side, while keeping your weight over your heels and both feet facing forward step your right leg to the side. Once your right foot is firmly placed on the floor, bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight towards the right foot. Continue shifting your weight over the right foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your right knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your right foot. The goal is to sit deep into the lunge brining the glutes level with the right knee. Your left leg should be at full extension at the knee and your body weight should still be distributed into the right hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Push through your right heel and lift the left leg off the floor bringing it in to starting position.
 
Step 5
Continue into the next over/under until you reach the end.  Facing the same direction, come back down the line leading with your left foot. 
 

When stepping over the broomstick, be sure not to step too wide to avoid contacting the broomstick with the extended leg.  Contacting the broom stick a can cause it to move resulting in a loss of balance and injury.  A common mistake when performing a body weight side lunge is that individuals often step too wide and are unable to align the tibia (shinbone) over the placed foot and the knee falls inside the foot. In this case, simply shorten the width of the step taken to allow you to align the tibia over the placed foot.

Starting position: Stand with feet hip-width apart. In this position, gently contract your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back while keeping your arms hanging comfortably along your side.
Step 2
Keep the right foot planted on the ground, (maintain balance through the movement by pressing the right foot into the ground while extending the leg and squeezing (contracting) both the thigh and glute muscles), lift the left knee so that it is straight in front of the hip and the hip is at a ninety degree angle.  Bend the arms at ninety degree angles, as you raise the left knee, swing the right arm forward to flex the right shoulder while swinging left arm back to create shoulder extension.
Step 3
Maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the core stiff and the spine straight, lean forward on the right hip while simultaneously extending the left hip behind your body, at the same time reach forward with the right arm to create right shoulder flexion and move the left elbow back to create left shoulder extension.  Keep the right foot firmly planted into the ground to maintain balance and stability.
Step 4
Continue flexing forward on the right hip (continue squeezing the right thigh and glutes to help maintain stability) while reaching forward with the left arm and extending the right leg backwards (into hip extension).  To help maintain balance, find a spot on the floor and fix your gaze on that spot, this will create additional stability.
Step 5
At the point where you feel your end range-of-motion while balanced on your right leg, reach forward with the left arm to fully extend the elbow while flexing the shoulder at the same time extend the left leg straight back to create full hip extension.  Point the toes of the left foot towards the wall behind you in order to move into full extension of the left hip (and concurrent flexion of the right hip); continue to maintain abdominal bracing to ensure balance and stability.  Try to keep the hips level and do not let the left hip drop towards the floor or roll away from the right (planted) leg.  Hold this position for 3-5 seconds.
Step 6
Maintain abdominal bracing and begin to lean back into the right hip while pulling the left hip forward (back into flexion) and the left arm back down towards your midsection.  Return to an upright, standing position and repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time.  Alternate legs and repeat for the same number of repetitions or period of time.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: To add resistance and increase the level of difficulty, hold a dumbbell in your left hand (the weight should be in the hand opposite of the standing (balance) leg).
 

If balancing on the right leg, use the left leg to help move into a position of flexion on the right hip; pointing the left leg backwards while pointing the toes and straightening the legs will help move the right hip into a position of flexion.

Starting Position:  From a standing position with your feet together or slightly apart, stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.   

Step 2
Gently exhale and bend forward from your hips (""hip hinging""), keeping your knees extended (but not locked), and extend your arms in front of your body while slowly lowering your torso towards the floor until you can place your fingers or palms of your hands on the floor in front of your body.  Maintaining a flat spine and a soft bend in your knees during this movement is acceptable.

Step 3
Slowly begin to walk your hands forward (6-12” or 12 ½ - 25 cm steps) without moving your feet (your heels will begin to rise off the floor).  Continue walking yourself forward until you reach a full-push-up position where your spine, hips and head are level with the floor (plank position).

Step 4
Perform one full push-up, lowering your chest and hips simultaneously to the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase.  Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.   

Step 5
Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.  Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms fully extend at the elbows.  Slowly begin walking your feet forward towards your hands, taking 6-12” steps without moving your hands.  Maintain a flat spine throughout and continue walking until your feet are close to your hands.  

Step 6
Repeat this movement and continue for 10 – 15 yards (9-13 m).

Step 7
Exercise Variation:  You can progress this exercise by adding multiple push-ups in the lowered position.

To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to monitor the position of your spine throughout the exercise.  Focus on keeping your spine flat and avoid any rounding of your low back.  Smaller steps help maintain correct body position.  Reaching too far forward with your arms will put unnecessary stress on the shoulders.

This exercise is a dynamic movement exercise used to prepare the body for activity. As it involves a modification to a traditional push-up, it is highly recommended you master your push-up technique before attempting this exercise.
Step 2
Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward or turned slightly inward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles (""bracing"")and glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles), and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Rotational Movement: Exhale and gently draw one knee up towards your chest, bending the knee and flexing at the hip. Do NOT allow your hips and low back to pitch upwards or sag down towards the floor.
Step 4
In this knee-tuck position, rotate your hips to move your bent leg across the front of your torso, but avoid rotating or dropping your hips. Continue to move until your hips cannot rotate any further. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise. Pause very briefly.
Step 5
Rotate in the opposite direction (away from your torso), rotating until your hips cannot rotate any further without movement in your spine. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise.

Starting Position: Set up six cones in a hexagon, making each segment about 2 feet long.  Each cone should be about 2-3 feet from the center point allowing enough room for you to take a large step.  Stand in the middle of the hexagon in line with a cone.  This will be your starting point.  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up.  Shift your weight over your heels.

Step 2
Ready Position:  Maintaining abdominal bracing, bend the knees and hinge at the hips (shift hips back) bringing the torso forward.  Allow the arms to flex (bend) at the elbow and remain close to your sides.  Shift your weight to the balls of your feet.

Step 3
Action:  With the left leg, take a large step forward toward the cone into a lunge while simultaneously driving and extending the right arm forward and down, palms facing in, to the lightly touch the top of the come.  Drive your left elbow backwards.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center.

Step 4
Moving counter clockwise to the next cone (left front rotational), rotate to the left, pivoting off your right foot and lunging with your left leg aligning your feet and hips in the direction you are stepping (toward the cone). Follow the same technique as listed in step 3.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center. 

Step 5
Continue counter clock-wise until you reach your starting point.  Repeat the drill lunging forward with your right foot and moving clock-wise.

Step 6
Exercise Variations:  (1) Perform this drill extending the same side arm toward the cone.  In this case, the opposite elbow would drive back behind the body.  (2) Once you become comfortable with the oblique angle lunges, you can focus more on exploding to the cone.  To increase the amount of explosion, widen the hexagon allowing you to take a couple steps forward then lunge to touch each cone.  Placing a cone in the middle will provide a reference point. 
 

It would be beneficial to practice the directional movements with stepping first to make sure your hip and foot alignment is correct before moving to the lunge. You may also have to adjust the size of the hexagon to a distance appropriate for you to perform the exercise correctly. Keep your arm movements strong and controlled.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or the floor in a bent-knee position with your feet flat on the floor. Place your feet hip-width apart with the toes facing away from you. Gently contract your abdominal muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this gentle muscle contraction throughout the exercise
Step 2
Upward Phase: Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and press your hips upwards off the floor into extension by contracting your glutes (butt muscles). At the same time press your heels into the floor for more stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back.
Step 3
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position.
Step 4
Progression: Gradually progress this exercise by starting with both feet together and extending one leg while in the raised position.
Avoid arching your lower back as your press your hips upward which normally occurs if your attempt to push your hips as high as possible. This can be achieved by contracting your abdominal muscles prior to lifting, and keeping them engaged throughout the lift

Starting Position: Stand with your feet together and your arms raised in front to shoulder height, with your elbows fully extended. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
From the same starting position, step out sideways with the right foot (both feet remain pointed forward) to the 3 o'clock position. Once the foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight over that same foot. Continue shifting your weight until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your knee is aligned directly over the second toe of that foot. Your left leg should be near, or at full extension while keeping the right foot flat. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor.
 
Step 3
While lunging, simultaneously move your arms and lean your torso in the opposite direction to the lunge movement, increasing the load on your glute muscle group. Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
 
Step 4
From the same starting position, step with one foot in front and across the body (both feet remain pointed forward). Once the foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight over that same foot. Continue shifting your weight until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your knee is aligned directly over the second toe of that foot. Your opposite leg should be flexed with the heel off the ground.
 
Step 5
While lunging, simultaneously rotate your torso and arms in the opposite direction to the lunge movement, increasing the load on your gluteal muscle group. Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
This series of multi-directional (multi-planar) lunges are intended to activate your glutes which protect your knee during walking, running and jumping-type activities. As many of us have weak glutes, this exercise can be performed as part of your pre-exercise warm-up. Given the moderate degree of complexity of the three movements, we recommend learning this exercise first without your arms and only progress to the arm drivers as you feel comfortable. It is suggested, you first learn how to perform single leg-stands on the ground and forward lunges before performing these glute activation lunges.

Contract your quadriceps to extend your legs and dorsiflex your ankles (pull toes towards your shins). Contract your core and abdominal muscles to stiffen your torso.
 
Step 2
Upward Phase. Slowly lift your entire torso off the floor or mat, maintaining a stiff torso and legs. Avoid any arching (sagging) in your low back, hiking (upwards) in your hips or bending in the knees. Avoid shrugging your shoulder and keep your shoulders positioned directly over your elbows with your palms facing down.

Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Walking Movement: Slowly lift one foot off the floor to clear the height of the cone, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward, pushing off your stance (supporting) leg to clear the cone.
 
Step 3
The raised leg should initiate contact over the cone with a heel strike first, followed by the mid- and fore-foot, transferring your body weight into that foot. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Your trailing leg needs to also clear the cone.
 
Step 4
Continue this sequence through the series of cones.
 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: This exercise can be progressed in several ways: (1) lift each leg higher off the floor (illustrated) to further challenge your balance (raising center of mass), (2) walk through the cones at a faster pace, (3) step sideways through the cones, or (4) step backwards through the cones.
 
Learn first how to perform single leg-stands on the ground and, if possible, on an Airex pad before performing cone walks.

Step 2
In preparation to step forward, slowly lift one foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward.

As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot.
 
Step 3
As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously, bend forward at your hips, maintaining a flat back and drive your extended arms towards the floor in front of you (hands should reach somewhere below your knees). This increases the load on your gluteal muscle group.

Starting Position: Lie in a supine (on your back) position on a mat with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor and heels 12 - 18"" from your tailbone.
 
Step 2
Place your hands behind your head, squeezing your scapulae (shoulder blades) together and pulling your elbows back without arching your low back. This elbow position should be maintained throughout the exercise. Align your head with your spine, but allow it to move into slight flexion (moving the chin towards the chest) during the upward phase of the exercise.
 
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale, contract your abdominal and core muscles and flex your chin slightly towards your chest while slowly curling your torso towards your thighs. The movement should focus on pulling your rib cage towards your pelvis (the neck stays relaxed while the chin is tucked towards the neck). Your feet, tailbone and lower back should remain in contact with the mat at all times. Continue curling up until your upper back is lifted off the mat. Hold this position briefly.
 
Step 4
Downward Phase: Gently inhale and slowly uncurl (lower) your torso back towards the mat in a controlled fashion keeping your feet, tailbone and low back in contact with the mat.
Proper form is important for this exercise to prevent excessive stress on your low back. Individuals usually perform this movement too rapidly and recruit the hip flexors to assist with the upward phase. This technique tilts the pelvis anteriorly, increasing the stress on the low back and should be avoided. The abdominals connect the rib cage to the pelvis so the movement should focus on bringing these two body parts closer together while keeping the neck and shoulders relaxed.

Starting Position: Place a BOSU® balance trainer on the floor 3-6"" in front of your feet on a non-slip surface. Stand with your feet hip-width apart or closer, arms by your sides, depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and ""brace"" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until you feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing the BOSU directly and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity onto the top of the BOSU, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, but bring them together to land on the top of the BOSU.
 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase on a BOSU are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
 
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase (illustrated), (2) driving your arms forward (illustrated) or upward (towards an overhead position) during the jumping phase, or (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phase.
It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and perform regular squat jumps before attempting to jump onto the BOSU.

Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards through your lower extremity onto the top of the BOSU, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, but bring them together to land on the top of the BOSU.
 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase on a BOSU are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
 
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity off the top of the BOSU towards the floor, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, moving them back to a hip-width stance (position) or slightly closer.
 
Step 8
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward, upward (towards an overhead position) and slightly sideways in the jumping direction during the jumping phases, (3)driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases or (4) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more BOSU balance trainers and performing a series of jumps in each direction.
Before attempting to jump laterally onto the BOSU, learn first how to squat and perform regular squat jumps, BOSU squat jumps and lateral cone jumps.

Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull the shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe. 
 
Step 5
From the Lowered Position: the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position. 
 
Think about inhaling on the way down and exhaling while exerting on the way back to the initial standing position.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body).
 
Step 2
Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders.
 
Step 3
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching.
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed.
 
Step 5
Shoulder flexion: Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement.
 
Step 6
The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles.
 
Step 7
Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs.
The bird-dog is an excellent exercise to train the body how to stabilize the lumbar spine (low back) during upper and lower extremity movement. Never exceed your body's capacity to control movement in the low back.

Starting Position: Place the end of a standard barbell in a corner so that it will not move unnecessarily, place a weight on one end of the barbell with a collar so that the weight can not fall off during the exercise.  Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, your toes pointed forward or slightly outward facing the end of the barbell so that it is between both feet and directly under your center of gravity.
 
Step 2
Squat down by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees, as you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward.  Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar). Position the end of the bar directly in front of your chest directly under your chin. Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward.
 
Step 3
Upward phase:  Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest.  Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position.
 
Step 4
As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
 
Step 5
As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension).
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise.
Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance. 


Technique is very important in this lift. Do not progress to explosive movements until you master your technique.
