Rotation Movement: Exhale and slowly rotate your arms at the shoulders without turning your head until you reach a point of tension. The leading arm will rotate behind your torso while the trailing arm will simply move across the front of your body. Hold briefly, inhale, then exhale and rotate in the opposite direction.
Step 3
Exercise Variation (1): To progress the exercise and mimic the golf swing more closely try moving your feet together and change your starting position where you are not bending over, but assuming a slightly bent-knee (1/4 squat) position. Extend your arms forward towards your knees rather than to chest level (pushing down on the handles of foot cradles) and rotate as described above.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs bent slightly deeper than 90 degrees at the hips, knees bent to 90 degrees, and feet overlapping each other.  Align your hips and shoulder vertically with the floor and spine and head in a straight line.  Extend your lower arm in front of your body at chest level, resting it upon the mat while reaching with your upper arm down under your trunk to firmly grasp your ribcage.  Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.
Step 2
Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk by pulling the ribcage around with your upper arm.  Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, (indicated by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate).  Continue rotating your trunk until your reach the point of tension, avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  The deeper bend at the hips and abdominal stiffening will help prevent any arching in your low back during the stretch.  Grasping under your ribcage will ensure rotation, and stretching of, your trunk and reduce shoulder stress that often occurs when the arm is extended and allowed to fall towards the floor (refer progression).
Step 3
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then repeat to the opposite side.
Step 4
Progression 1: Extend the lower leg, while resting the inside of the upper knee on a small riser.  In this position, the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk, evidenced by a backwards slide of the upper knee during the rotation.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips while only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.
Step 5
Progression 2: Remove the riser under the upper knee and place it firmly against the mat / floor.  In this position, the upper knee may rise off the floor and the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk.  Your objective is to stabilize your hips by pressing the knee into the floor and only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.
Step 6
Progression 3: Repeat the same exercise, but begin with both arms extended in front of your body at chest level.  As you begin to rotate, bend the upper elbow, sliding it towards your trunk, then extending the arm outwards again at chest level as you continue your rotation.  Continue your rotation until the point of tension in the trunk and shoulder, but avoid arching your back or rotating your hips. This will increase the stretch in the shoulder and chest region, in addition to your trunk.

Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs extended so that your hips and shoulder are aligned vertically with the floor and your spine and head are in alignment (head resting on the mat or upon a small pillow or rolled-up towel). Bend your upper leg to create a 90-degree bend at both the hip and knee, resting the inside of that knee upon the mat or upon a raised platform, (e.g., rolled-up towel, block, etc.). Extend both arms out directly in front you at chest level, overlapping your fingers together.  
Step 2
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine in a neutral position and maintain this throughout the exercise. Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk and upper arm until your belly button faces the ceiling and your upper arm extends out to the side, either touching or being elevated slightly above the floor. 
Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, evidenced by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate.  Placement of a raised platform under the inside of the upper knee will help control this hip rotation.  Additionally, avoid any arching in your low back that may accompany the rotation. Stiffening ("bracing") your abdominal muscles will help prevent this.   
Step 3
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.  Hold this position briefly, then flex (bend) the elbow of the lower arm so that the back of the arm rests against the floor / mat, while the forearm is aligned vertically to the floor.   Extend the other arm vertically towards the ceiling, but do not allow the scapula to move (i.e., hold it in the depressed and retracted position). 
Step 4
Gently exhale and while stabilizing your scapulae (shoulder blades), trunk and hips, perform a series of push-pull movements with your arms:
(a) Press the lower arm upwards, extending the elbow without allowing the scapula to move forward
(b) Pull the upper arm downwards towards the chest, flexing (bending) the elbow without allowing the scapula to move backwards.
Step 5
Exercise Variation: The exercise intensity can be increased by using dumbbells.
 
To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stabilize the scapulae, trunk and hips and control movement at the shoulders.  Follow the instructions provided carefully.', 'Spinal Twist with a Push-Pull Movement', 'No Equipment', 'Back, Chest, Shoulders', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/219-1.jpg');

Your hands should be shoulder-width apart. Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles ("bracing"). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your torso to rotate, your low back or hips to sag or pitch upwards. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thighs) to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back or hips to sag or hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.

Step 2
“I” Formation: Gently exhale and slowly extend your arms overhead keeping your elbows extended, while maintaining your depressed shoulder position and stable spine (avoid arching your back). Individuals experiencing some limitations in their flexibility will tend to shrug their shoulders and arch their back during this movement.  Continue to move your arms overhead until your thumbs touch the floor overhead, or until you reach the point of tension, but avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions.

Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward or turned slightly inward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles ("bracing"), your glute and quadriceps muscles and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat/floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. For extra strength think about pushing the floor away from you. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
Step 5
An alternative position is to turn your hands to face forwards and keep your your elbows close to your sides during the downward phase. This shifts the emphasis from the chest muscles onto the triceps and may reduce stresses in the shoulder joint.
Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.', 'Push-up', 'No Equipment', 'Arms, Chest, Shoulders', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/41-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and holding a medicine ball in both hands directly in front of your chest; grasp the ball with your hands in a neutral position (palms facing each other), and elbows fully flexed (bent) and facing down towards the floor. 
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) and engage your abdominal / core muscles ("bracing") to stiffen your torso and support your spine. Maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and reach the medicine ball back between your legs to prepare to bring it up overhead in a rapid motion.  
 
Step 3
Upward phase: Swing the medicine ball upwards over your head while reaching it back behind your head and neck and simultaneously straightening your legs and rolling up on the balls of your toes to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension); lean back while pushing the hips forward to lengthen the abdominal muscles, keep the abdominals contracted and engaged (bracing) throughout the movement to ensure spinal stability.  
Step 4
Explosively bring the ball down over your head to throw it directly downwards into the floor while dropping your weight back into your hips.  As you throw the ball down, make sure you are maintaining the abdominal bracing and hinge from the hips to maintain spinal stability.
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Use a bouncing medicine ball to throw it straight down and have the ball bounce back up into your hands to perform continuous repetitions. 
If using a bouncing medicine ball make sure that you have ample space for safety; if you are using a non-bouncing medicine ball (a "dead" ball) make sure you are on a solid, stable floor that can support the force of the weight being thrown explosively into the floor.', 'Overhead Slams', 'Medicine Ball', 'Back, Butt/Hips, Full Body/Integrated, Legs - Thighs, Shoulders', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/182-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, let the partner feel the medicine ball first so they know how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it.  Position your body directly facing your partner with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor.  Stand with the feet hip-width apart, the left foot slightly forward, the right foot slightly back while holding a medicine ball between both hands; contract and brace the abdominals while depressing and retracting your shoulder blades.  Your eyes should be looking directly at the target in order to properly aim the throw. 
Step 2
Keep your feet pressed into the ground, continue to contract and brace your abdominal  muscles, swing your arms upwards to lift the medicine ball overhead and bend your elbows to reach the medicine ball behind your head.  As you lift the ball over your head, shift your weight back into your right leg and lean back to engage the core muscles for extra power for the throw.  While preparing to throw the ball aim the throw by keeping your eyes on your partners hands as you pull the ball back over your head.
 
Step 3
Explosively step forward with the right leg and quickly bring your arms forward over your head to generate power for throwing the ball.  While stepping forward with the right leg, push the left leg into the ground create triple extension (ankle plantar flexion with knee and hip extension) and generate more forward momentum for the ball. 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: Repeating throws: Use a wall with a medicine ball capable of bouncing and position yourself so that you can throw the ball into the wall and quickly catch it to prepare for the next throw. 
The purpose of this exercise is to generate upper body power, use a ball that is no more than 10% of your bodyweight to ensure that you can acheive the appropriate velocity for the throw.', 'Overhead Medicine Ball Throws', 'Medicine Ball', 'Butt/Hips, Full Body/Integrated, Shoulders', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/178-1.jpg');

Carefully shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands and the medicine ball. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body without any sagging (downwards) or hiking (upwards) at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles ("bracing"). Your head should be aligned with your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the ball while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during the downward phase. Contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to help maintain stability. Continue to lower yourself until your chest nears or lightly touches the ball. Your elbows should either remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
Step 4
An alternate ball with handles can be substituted that reduces the pressure on your wrists. When using this type of ball, maintain a neutral wrist position throughout the exercise.

Before you begin make sure that you are working with a partner who can catch the ball, (let the partner feel the medicine ball first so he or she knows how much it weighs and can prepare to catch it) or be sure that you have a solid wall or medicine ball rebounder that can withstand the forces of impact from a medicine ball.  
Starting Position: Stand on the floor in an athletic ready position with both feet hip-width apart, position your body directly facing your partner (or wall / rebounder), your should be at least 5-8 feet away from your partner and each partner should maintain the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest lifted up, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).   Firmly hold a medicine ball between both hands right in front of your chest; contract and brace the abdominals and keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes.  Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target. 
 
Step 2
The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, the hips slightly flexed, the abdominals engaged and both hands held straight in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball.  The person throwing the ball should step forward with the right foot into a forward lunge, as the right foot hits the ground bend your left knee to allow you to sink into your right hip simultaneously push the medicine ball away from your chest to throw it directly to your partner. 
Step 3
The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of his or her body, as the medicine ball hits the hands, allow it to decelerate towards the chest.  Once the catching partner catches the medicine ball he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge to throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw who should be standing with the hips flexed, both feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of his or her body to prepare to catch the ball.  
Step 4
The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched hands prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge. 
Step 5
The partner catching the ball should first catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement.  Perform a number of lunge and throws stepping with one leg before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward with the other leg.
Step 6
Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge. 
 
During the entire thowing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner''s hands to ensure good aim).', 'Medicine Ball Lunge to Chest Pass', 'Medicine Ball', 'Abs, Back, Butt/Hips, Chest, Full Body/Integrated, Shoulders', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/264-1.jpg');

If working with a spotter, signal the spotter for assistance in handing you the dumbbells.
Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) to make firm contact with the bench. Your head, shoulders, butt and feet should make contact with the bench and floor/riser throughout the exercise. Signal the spotter for assistance in moving to the starting position.

Hold a light-to-moderate weight medicine ball in front of your chest with both hands firmly holding on to the ball. 
Step 2
Step forward slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg.  Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and press the left (stance / supporting) foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (forward) leg with the foot placed firmly on the floor, think about lowering yourself into your hips by allowing your weight to shift downwards towards the floor instead of forward. As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (supporting) foot. While simultaneously lowering yourself into your right leg and hip, lift your hands holding the medicine ball straight overhead while continuing to maintain the abdominal bracing.
Step 3
While in the bottom (downward) phase of the lunge, pull the medicine ball back down towards your chest, continue to maintain a stiff core and drive your right foot into the ground to extend the right knee and straighten the leg to return to the original (starting) position of standing with both feet under the hips and the ball held in front of the chest.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time. 
Step 4
Exercise Variation: Begin with a light-weight medicine ball in order to learn how to maintain stability all of the way through the movement.  To increase the level of difficulty and to improve core and shoulder strength, once you can perform 8-12 repetitions on each leg, increase the weight of the medicine ball.  Another option is to hold one dumbbell in each hand, start with the elbows bent at ninety degrees and tucked in to the side, at the bottom of the lunge, bend the elbows to bring the weight up to the shoulders and press it directly overhead.

Step 2
Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal/core muscles ("bracing"), and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back), maintaining this position throughout the exercise. Your head position should be aligned with your spine.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells up in front of your body. Your elbows and upper arms should rise together and be slightly ahead of your forearms and dumbbells. As your arms move past 60 - 70 degrees (nearing shoulder level), slowly rotate them upwards somewhat so that the inside edge of the dumbbells point slightly upwards. Continue raising the dumbbells until your arms are level with your shoulders and approximately parallel with the floor. Maintain an erect torso (no arching of your low back) and neutral wrist position (avoid flexion and extension of your wrists).

Starting Position: Place the end of a standard barbell in a corner so that it will not move unnecessarily, place a weight on one end of the barbell with a collar so that the weight can not fall off during the exercise.  Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, your toes pointed forward or slightly outward facing the end of the barbell so that it is between both feet and directly under your center of gravity.
 
Step 2
Squat down by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees, as you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward.  Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar). Position the end of the bar directly in front of your chest directly under your chin. Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward.
 
Step 3
Upward phase:  Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest.  Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position.
 
Step 4
As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
 
Step 5
As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension).
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise.
Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance. 

Technique is very important in this lift.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet about hip width apart. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and "brace" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.  Hold a medicine ball in front of your mid-section with a firm grip by both hands.
Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg. Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and keep the left (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (stance / supporting) foot. 
Step 3
As you lunge forward, focus more on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your left knee towards the heel of your right foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your left while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section. 
Step 4
From the lowered position, rotate back to the right so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the right foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the right knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously.  As you are pulling yourself foward with the right leg, pick the left leg off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Step 5
While balancing on the right leg, step forward with the left foot off the floor, stabilize your body by maintaining the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body.  Keep the right (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the left (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the left leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the  right (stance / supporting) foot. 
 
Step 6
As you continue into the next lunge with the left foot forward, keep the focus on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your right (back) knee towards the heel of your left (front) foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your left (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your right while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section. 
Step 7
From the lowered position, rotate back to the left so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the left foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the left knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously.  As you are pulling yourself foward with the left leg, pick the right foot off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Step 8
Continue the walking lunge with rotation for a specific number of repetitions or a certain distance.
 
Step 9
One variation is to contract the abdominals and glutes at the top of the stance phase (for example while balanced on the right leg with the left leg off of the ground) for 2-3 seconds to create a balance challenge.  Another variation is to add more resistance by holding one dumbbell in each hand with the elbows bent at 90 degrees and pressed into the sides of the abdominals.

Your suspended foot should be dorsiflexed at the ankle (toes pulled towards your shin).
Step 2
Adopt a modified sprinter-stance with the right leg flexed to 90 degrees, knees aligned side by side, and the left arm flexed to 90 degrees at the elbow with the finger tips level with or just below your chin. Your right arm should also be flexed to 90 degrees, driving it back from the shoulder until the upper arm lies approximately 45 degrees from vertical.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower your body towards the floor, shifting the hips backwards simultaneously and maintaining your body weight over the heel of your left foot. As your body lowers, the suspended leg will drive backwards, maintaining the 90 degree bend at the knee. Your right arm should drive forward from the shoulder towards the a end-position where the left arm started. Your left arm should simultaneously drive backwards to an end-position where the right arm started. Throughout the arm movements, squeeze the arms to the sides of your body and drive from the shoulders while maintaining the 90 degree bends. Continue to lower yourself maintaining weight over your left heel until your right thigh and torso are in parallel (form a straight line together). Your left tibia (shinbone) should move level with or slightly ahead of the ball of your left foot.
Step 4
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press your body upwards by pushing down against the floor through your left heel. The muscle action at the knee and hips extend the body back to your starting position.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): To increase the exercise intensity move more explosively to triple extension. The upward phase should be performed more explosively and incorporating triple extension (at the ankle, knee and hip).
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2): To increase the exercise intensity move the upper extremity into different planes. While the lower extremity moves in the sagittal plane (front and back), the upper extremity and/or arms can move in the frontal (left and right) and transverse plane (rotation).
Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints. While this certainly can promote additional range of movement, it does necessitate additional attention to proper form.', 'TRX ® Suspended Lunge', 'TRX', 'Abs, Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/93-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Place your feet securely into the foot cradles positioned directly under the anchor point. Apply downward pressure with the tops of your feet by plantarflexing your ankles (point toes away from your shins). Gently lie flat on your stomach with your hands placed shoulder-width apart, under your shoulders and facing forward. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles ("bracing"), and your glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles).
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press yourself upward until your elbows are fully extended, aligning your head and spine (avoid any sagging or aching in your low back or hips hiking upwards). Keep your feet together throughout the exercise and avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps. Slowly pull your knees toward your chest, bending your knees as they tuck under your hips, keeping your feet together and ankles in plantarflexion (toes pointed away from your shins). During this movement, your hips will rise upwards and your spine will flex (curl into a ball). Continue pulling your knees inwards until they lie directly under your hips.

Hollowing Movement: Breathe normally and at the end of your breaths (end-tidal volume), perform the following actions individually at first, then combine them together:
Perform a gentle "kegel" contraction without moving your hips or ribcage (the kegel contraction of the pelvic floor is the same contraction your would perform when resisting the urge to urinate).
Draw your belly button towards your spine without moving your hips or rib cage (visualize narrowing your waist circumference without taking a deep breath). Any movement of the hips or rib cage indicates activation of your larger abdominal muscles (e.g. rectus abdominis).

Exercise Progressions: Once your have spent time learning how to co-contract the muscles of the pelvic floor and core, independent of breathing, progress the exercise complexity by adding small movements in the lower extremity:
Lift one leg 3 - 6" (no more) off the mat and hold this position briefly (illustrated) without moving your torso (hips, shoulders or increasing your low-back arch).
Heel slide, lifting the toes in one foot off the floor and slowly sliding the heel of one foot 3-6" away from your body. without moving your torso (hips, shoulders or increasing your low-back arch)
 
This series of exercise movements activate your core muscles that are often neglected. Good core activity (independent of your larger, more superficial abdominal muscles like your rectus abdominis) helps stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine against injury.

Perform this exercise in a slow, controlled manner
Do not pull forward on your head during the trunk curl.  Support your head in your hands while maintaining alignment of your head with your thoracic (upper) spine.
During the upward and downward movement of your trunk, it is important to keep your low back pressed into the floor / mat. 
The rotation should come from your trunk and not your hips.  While your legs drive forward and backwards in a straight line, your trunk will flex (curl) and rotate.

Step 2
Stand in a split-stance position with your left foot forward. Hold a medicine in both hands, keeping the ball relatively close to the your body. Contract your abdominal / core muscles to stiffen your torso, holding it vertical to the floor. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulder down and back) without arching your low back
Step 3
Stage One Starting Position (illustrated): Slowly rotate your arms with the medicine ball to the left, to a starting position high and behind you, but do not rotate your head, chest or torso. Your head, chest and hips should remain facing forward at all times throughout this exercise stage. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body.
Step 4
Movement: Slowly, rotate your arms down and across your body to the right, to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned near your right hip (performing a wood chop movement). Do not rotate your head, chest, torso or hips, and keep them facing forward. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body. Hold this end position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat the movement in the opposite direction with your opposite leg forward.
Step 5
Exercise Progression: Repeat the same movement, but extend your arms at the elbow and maintain this arm position throughout the wood chop movements. This longer lever increases the loading on the spine, requiring the core muscles to work harder
Step 6
Stage Two Starting Position (not illustrated): Change your foot position to a stagger-stance by widening your base of support (moving feet wider apart). Assume the same starting position with your bent arms, but allow your hips to rotate to the left with your arms, increasing your degree of rotation. Your head, chest and torso should remain aligned over your hips. Much of your body weight should be loaded into your left leg.

Movement: Slowly, rotate your arms down and across your body to the right, while squatting down slightly to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned lower than your your right hip (performing a wood chop movement), and much of your weight has shifted over into the right leg. Rotate your hips, but keep your head, chest and torso aligned over your hips. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body. Hold this end position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat the movement in the opposite direction with your opposite leg forward.
Step 8
Exercise Progression: Repeat the same movement, but extend your arms at the elbow and maintain this arm position throughout the wood chop movements. This longer lever increases the loading on the spine, requiring the core muscles to work harder
Step 9
Stage Three Starting Position (illustrated): Assume the same starting position as in stage two, but fully extend your elbows and allow your torso to rotate further than your hips, increasing your degree of rotation around. Shift more weight into your left foot and allow your right foot to pivot on the floor.
Step 10
Movement: Slowly, rotate your arms down and across your body to the right, while squatting down slightly to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned below your right hip (performing a wood chop movement), and much of your weight has shifted into the right leg. Your torso will rotate further and faster than your hips. Keep your elbows fully extended throughout the movement. Hold this end position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat the movement in the opposite direction with your opposite leg forward.

Place your hands behind your head, squeezing your scapulae (shoulder blades) together and pulling your elbows back without arching your low back. This elbow position should be maintained throughout the exercise. Align your head with your spine, but allow it to move into slight flexion (moving the chin towards the chest) during the upward phase of the exercise.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale, contract your abdominal and core muscles, and flex your chin slightly towards your chest while slowly curling your torso towards your thighs. Since the abdominals attach the rib cage to the pelvis, your movement should focus on pulling these two body parts closer together (the neck stays relaxed while the chin is tucked towards the neck and focus on pulling the bottom of the chest towards the top of the pelvis). Your feet should remain firmly planted, and your tailbone and lower back should remain in contact with the ball at all times. Continue curling up until your upper back is lifted off the ball. Hold this position briefly while maintaining your balance.
Step 4

Step 3
Continue to bend and reach forward to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times.  Repeat with the opposite leg.

Starting Position: You and a training partner should have specialized resistance x-pattern resistance tubing with four handles so that two people can use it at the same time; or take 2 pieces of standard resistance tubing with handles and cross them to interlink them and create a 4-handled pattern (pictured).  You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; lean forward to hinge at your hips with your knees slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability.  You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) and the scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together).  You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your heads in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).  Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing each other and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull.  
Step 2
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core.  At the same time you and your partner should each pull back on the handles, the pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades (which are rectraced), use your triceps (upper arm muscles) to extend (straighten) your arms directly behind you.
Step 3
When you and your partner have each extended (straightened) your arms, you should continue to maintain spinal stability while holding the arms in a straight line and pushing against the resistance.
Step 4
You and your partner should simultaneously allow your right arm to flex (bend) slowly at the elbow working against and decelerating the pull of the resistance while holding the left arm in a straight line of elbow extension. 
Step 5
You and your partner should each simultaneously engage the upper muscles (triceps) of the right arm to push the resistance back while extending (straightening) the arm while simultaneously allowing the left arm to slowly flex (bend) at the elbow while working against the pull of the elastic resistance.  Continue alternating the action of the arms; you and your partner should each hold your right arm in extension while bending and straightening the left arm, then alternate to hold the left arm straight in extension while bending and straightening the right arm. 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the exercise, stand further away from your partner to create more resistance through the rubber resistance, or increase the speed (velocity) of the movement for enhanced power production and work-rate.

Starting Position: Two training partners should stand approximately arm''s length away from one another with their feet slightly wider than hip width apart with your toes pointed forward or slightly outward.  Position your feet so that the balls of your feet align under your center of gravity. Each partner should outstretch his or her arms so they can grasp each other''s forearms with their hands.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Each partner should start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight.  Each partner should maintain a firm grip and allow each other to lean back slightly in order to be able to sink deeper into the hips for a greater range-of-motion.
Step 3
Each person should continue to lower themself until their thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until their heels begin to lift off the floor, or until their torso begins to round or flex forward. Each person should monitor his or her feet, ankles and knees, to maintain control of their feet and knees each person should think about pushing the floor away from them while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as they return to a standing position. 
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe, and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: While keeping a firm grip on one another''s forearms, each person should maintain a straight trunk with a head-up position, and exhale while extending the hips and knees by pushing their feet into the floor through the heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Each person should continue extending his or her hips until returning to the starting position. 
 
Step 5 
Exercise Variation: Each partner can place his or her feet in a split-squat position with the feet hip width apart and one foot slightly in front of the other.  Each partner can balance on a single leg and perform a single leg squat, the act of the partners holding on to one another during the squatting movement will help to maintain the balance on one leg.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia (shinbone) forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent the excess arching in the back with this correction. If using a squat rack, the safety rungs on the rack should be positioned at mid-thigh level.', 'Partner Assisted Bodyweight Squats', 'No Equipment', 'Abs, Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/265-1.jpg');

Step 2
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilize your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg and avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body by maintaining the abdominal bracing.  Keep the left (stance/supporting) foot pressed firmly into the ground, hold this position momentarily before stepping forward with the right foot. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading/forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower yourself into the right leg, maintain a straight spine by leaning forward from the hips and lower your right elbow on the inside of your right knee. 
 
Step 3
As you lower yourself into the lunge, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Place both hands on the floor with the right slightly forward of the left and continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean.  While in the lowered position with both hands on the floor, push back through the left foot to extend the left hip and maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the pelvis stable and increase the stretch to the left hip flexor.
Step 4
From the lowered position, keep your abdominals braced and push your hands into the floor to begin to raise yourself back to a standing position.  Press the right (forward) foot into the ground and drive the right knee backwards to create knee and hip extension and pull yourself forward into a standing position.  Keep your chest lifted and abdominals braced to maintain a straight spine and level pelvis while beginning to swing the left leg forward to initiate the next repetition and stretch in to the right hip.

Shift your bodyweight into your left leg and lift your right foot off of the ground and bend at the hips, pushing them backwards, while simultaneously shifting your weight to your left leg.  Maintain abdominal “bracing” and alignment. Continue loading your weight into the LEFT leg while lifting the right foot off the ground and bringing your right leg over the broomstick to hip flexion with your knee at a 90 degree angle in alignment with your hips. Your right foot should remain in dorsi-flexion (toes pulled up towards your shin) with the toes pointing forward. Place the right foot down on the opposite side of the broomstick (dowel rod) and shift your weight into your right hip to prepare to bring your left foot over the obstacle to place it next to the right. Level your hips and secure your balance.
 
Step 3
Place your right foot on the ground and bend at the hips, pushing them backwards, while simultaneously shifting your weight to your right leg.  Maintain abdominal “bracing” and alignment. Continue loading your weight into the RIGHT leg while lifting the left foot off the ground and bringing your left leg over the broomstick to hip flexion with your knee at a 90 degree angle in alignment with your hips. Your left foot should remain in dorsi-flexion (the toes pulled up towards the shin) with the toes pointing forward. Level your hips and secure your balance. Place your left foot on the ground, ending in the same body position as you started.
 
Step 4
“Unders” Continue the exercise stepping your right foot to the side, while keeping your weight over your heels and both feet facing forward step your right leg to the side. Once your right foot is firmly placed on the floor, bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight towards the right foot. Continue shifting your weight over the right foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your right knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your right foot. The goal is to sit deep into the lunge brining the glutes level with the right knee. Your left leg should be at full extension at the knee and your body weight should still be distributed into the right hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Push through your right heel and lift the left leg off the floor bringing it in to starting position.
 
Step 5
Continue into the next over/under until you reach the end.  Facing the same direction, come back down the line leading with your left foot. 
 
When stepping over the broomstick, be sure not to step too wide to avoid contacting the broomstick with the extended leg.  Contacting the broom stick a can cause it to move resulting in a loss of balance and injury.  A common mistake when performing a body weight side lunge is that individuals often step too wide and are unable to align the tibia (shinbone) over the placed foot and the knee falls inside the foot. In this case, simply shorten the width of the step taken to allow you to align the tibia over the placed foot.', 'Lateral Over Unders', 'No Equipment, Raised Platform/Box', 'Abs, Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/206-1.jpg');

Exercise Variation: To add resistance and increase the level of difficulty, hold a dumbbell in your left hand (the weight should be in the hand opposite of the standing (balance) leg).
 
If balancing on the right leg, use the left leg to help move into a position of flexion on the right hip; pointing the left leg backwards while pointing the toes and straightening the legs will help move the right hip into a position of flexion.', 'Inverted Flyers', 'No Equipment', 'Abs, Butt/Hips, Full Body/Integrated, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/144-1.jpg');

This exercise is a dynamic movement exercise used to prepare the body for activity. As it involves a modification to a traditional push-up, it is highly recommended you master your push-up technique before attempting this exercise.
Step 2
Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat and bring your feet together behind you. Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward or turned slightly inward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal / core muscles ("bracing")and glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles), and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
Step 3
Rotational Movement: Exhale and gently draw one knee up towards your chest, bending the knee and flexing at the hip. Do NOT allow your hips and low back to pitch upwards or sag down towards the floor.
Step 4
In this knee-tuck position, rotate your hips to move your bent leg across the front of your torso, but avoid rotating or dropping your hips. Continue to move until your hips cannot rotate any further. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise. Pause very briefly.
Step 5
Rotate in the opposite direction (away from your torso), rotating until your hips cannot rotate any further without movement in your spine. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise.', 'Hip Rotations (Push-up Position)', 'No Equipment', 'Abs, Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/110-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Set up six cones in a hexagon, making each segment about 2 feet long.  Each cone should be about 2-3 feet from the center point allowing enough room for you to take a large step.  Stand in the middle of the hexagon in line with a cone.  This will be your starting point.  Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up.  Shift your weight over your heels.
Step 2
Ready Position:  Maintaining abdominal bracing, bend the knees and hinge at the hips (shift hips back) bringing the torso forward.  Allow the arms to flex (bend) at the elbow and remain close to your sides.  Shift your weight to the balls of your feet.
Step 3
Action:  With the left leg, take a large step forward toward the cone into a lunge while simultaneously driving and extending the right arm forward and down, palms facing in, to the lightly touch the top of the come.  Drive your left elbow backwards.  The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center.
Step 4
Moving counter clockwise to the next cone (left front rotational), rotate to the left, pivoting off your right foot and lunging with your left leg aligning your feet and hips in the direction you are stepping (toward the cone). Follow the same technique as listed in step 3.  Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center. 
Step 5
Continue counter clock-wise until you reach your starting point.  Repeat the drill lunging forward with your right foot and moving clock-wise.
Step 6
Exercise Variations:  (1) Perform this drill extending the same side arm toward the cone.  In this case, the opposite elbow would drive back behind the body.  (2) Once you become comfortable with the oblique angle lunges, you can focus more on exploding to the cone.  To increase the amount of explosion, widen the hexagon allowing you to take a couple steps forward then lunge to touch each cone.  Placing a cone in the middle will provide a reference point. 
 
It would be beneficial to practice the directional movements with stepping first to make sure your hip and foot alignment is correct before moving to the lunge. You may also have to adjust the size of the hexagon to a distance appropriate for you to perform the exercise correctly.

Upward Phase: Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and press your hips upwards off the floor into extension by contracting your glutes (butt muscles). At the same time press your heels into the floor for more stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back.

Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position.
Step 4
Progression: Gradually progress this exercise by starting with both feet together and extending one leg while in the raised position.
Avoid arching your lower back as your press your hips upward which normally occurs if your attempt to push your hips as high as possible.

Step 2
From the same starting position, step out sideways with the right foot (both feet remain pointed forward) to the 3 o''clock position. Once the foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight over that same foot. Continue shifting your weight until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your knee is aligned directly over the second toe of that foot. Your left leg should be near, or at full extension while keeping the right foot flat. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor.
 
Step 3
While lunging, simultaneously move your arms and lean your torso in the opposite direction to the lunge movement, increasing the load on your glute muscle group. Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
 
Step 4
From the same starting position, step with one foot in front and across the body (both feet remain pointed forward). Once the foot is firmly placed on the floor, begin to bend at the hips, pushing them backwards while simultaneously shifting your weight over that same foot. Continue shifting your weight until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your knee is aligned directly over the second toe of that foot.

Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
This series of multi-directional (multi-planar) lunges are intended to activate your glutes which protect your knee during walking, running and jumping-type activities. As many of us have weak glutes, this exercise can be performed as part of your pre-exercise warm-up.

Step 2
Walking Movement: Slowly lift one foot off the floor to clear the height of the cone, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward, pushing off your stance (supporting) leg to clear the cone.

Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity off the top of the BOSU towards the floor, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, moving them back to a hip-width stance (position) or slightly closer.
 
Step 8
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward, upward (towards an overhead position) and slightly sideways in the jumping direction during the jumping phases, (3)driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases or (4) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more BOSU balance trainers and performing a series of jumps in each direction.
Before attempting to jump laterally onto the BOSU, learn first how to squat and perform regular squat jumps, BOSU squat jumps and lateral cone jumps.', 'BOSU® Lateral Jumps', 'BOSU Trainer', 'Abs, Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/119-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull the shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don''t move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe. 
 
Step 5
From the Lowered Position: the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding. 
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position. 
 
Think about inhaling on the way down and exhaling while exerting on the way back to the initial standing position.

Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body).
 
Step 2
Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders.
 
Step 3
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching.
 
Step 4
Upward Phase: This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed.
 
Step 5
Shoulder flexion: Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement.
 
Step 6
The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles.
 
Step 7
Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs.
The bird-dog is an excellent exercise to train the body how to stabilize the lumbar spine (low back) during upper and lower extremity movement. Never exceed your body''s capacity to control movement in the low back.', 'Bird-dog', 'No Equipment', 'Abs, Back, Butt/Hips', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/14-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Place your feet securely in the foot cradles positioned directly under the TRX anchor point. Apply downward pressure with your heels by dorsiflexing your ankles (toes point towards your shins) Gently lie back on a mat / floor with your arms at your sides and palms flat on the ground. Contract your core and glute muscles to lift your hips off the mat / floor keeping your body aligned and rigid, using your hands to help stabilize your body. Slowly contract your hamstrings to move your heels towards your hips while keeping your ankles in dorsiflexion. The hips should move into flexion (bending in the hips), but your torso should remain rigid with your weight bearing on your shoulders. Keep you feet together throughout the exercise.
Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale and press your hips towards the ceiling, extending your hips into a rigid straight line, but avoid arching your lower back. Avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly return your hips to your starting position. Avoid any back and forth swinging of the TRX straps.
Step 4
Progression: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by lengthening the straps and positioning your body further away from under the anchor point of the TRX.
During this exercise, individuals often arch their back to press the hips as high as possible. This increases the stresses on the low back and should be avoided.

Starting Position: You and a training partner should have specialized resistance x-pattern resistance tubing with four handles so that two people can use it at the same time; or take 2 pieces of standard resistance tubing with handles and cross them to interlink them and create a 4-handled pattern.  You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; your knees and hips should be slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability.  You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together).  You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised).  Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing the ground and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull. 
Step 2
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core.  At the same time you and your partner should each pull back on the handles, the pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades (which are rectraced), continue holding on to the handles but think about pulling from the elbows to engage the upper back and shoulder muscles. 
Step 3
Once you and your partner have pulled the handles back (into shoulder extension) you each should hold your shoulder blades retracted in an isometric contraction.  With both arms held in an isometric contraction you and your partner should each allow your right arm to come forward in shoulder flexion (arm moving forward towards your training partner) while maintaining the left arm in a position of shoulder extension.
Step 4
Once you and your partner have each allowed your right arm to move forward and pulled it back, you each should keep the right elbow next to the body with the right shoulder held in an isometric contraction (allowing no movement) while you each reach the left arm forward (the shoulder moves into flexion).  Continue the abdominal bracing and alternate the arm movements, you and your partner should work together to provide resistance to one another while simultaneously pulling back on the bands to keep the tension.   
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Start with slow, steady consistent movements to become used to providing manual resistane through the tension of the rubber tubing; to increase the intensity you can either stand further away from each other to create additional tension on the rubber or increase the speed of the movement to make it more of a power-based exercise.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or the floor in a bent-knee position with your feet flat on the floor and your arms resting comfortably along your side with the palms rotated up to face the ceiling. Start with your feet hip-width apart with the toes facing away from you, lift the left leg and place both hands on the back of the thigh to gently pull your left knee towards your chest, slide the right foot in (towards the center of the body). Gently contract your abdominal muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this abdominal stiffness throughout the exercise. 
 
Step 2
Upward Phase: Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and the back of your left thigh; press your right foot into the ground and lift upwards off the floor into hip extension by contracting (squeezing) your right glute (butt muscle). At the same time press your right heel into the floor for more stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back.
 
Step 3
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position by controlling the action of the right hip.  Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time; then alternate legs. 
 
Step 4 
Exercise Variation: To increase the strength of the muscles along the front of the shin (anterior tibilias) pick the toes of the right foot off of the floor to hold the foot in dorsiflexion-this is a good option for runners because it could help reduce the risk of developing shin splints.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, facing outward or turned slightly outwards while holding a dumbbell in each hand by your sides, with palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back).
 
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Curl the dumbbells to a starting position where they rest on the front edge of your shoulders or just in front of your shoulders. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, and shift your weight over your heels.
 
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Attempt to keep your back flat.
 
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don''t move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe.
 
Step 5
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding.
 
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position.
Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the tibia (shinbone) too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your tibia forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright back (moving it more upright), but do so from the hips and not through the low back.

Slowly lift yourself into a push-up position, shifting your hands until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your feet as needed to allow full extension of your body. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles to prevent any arching in your low back or hiking of your hips towards the ceiling.
 
Step 2
Upward Phase: While maintaining a rigid torso and full extension in your arms and legs, slowly exhale and shift your weight backwards by pushing your hips backwards and upwards. Maintain your head alignment with your spine, but slowly move your head between your shoulders as your body moves backwards and attempt to push your heels towards the floor. Maintain the stiffness in your torso to prevent the tendency of your back to arch. Continue moving until your body forms an inverted-V, keeping both arms and legs extended and a neutral (flat) spine.

Continue to lower yourself until you feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms along your sides where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support. 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, pull your knees up towards your chest and try to bring your heels right underneath your glute muscles; while in the air try to keep your feet level with each other and the bottoms parallel to the floor. 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.  Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impact forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries

Repeat this movement in one direction or stopping to turn back towards your starting position.
Step 7
Exercise Variation: The dynamic balance challenge to the body can be increased in this exercise by: (1) Pivoting faster without losing postural control (balance) or (2) pivoting with a backward rotation off the other foot rather than pivoting in a forward rotation.

Step 2
In preparation to step forward, slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The raised (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot.
 
Step 3
As you lower yourself forward into the lunge position, maintain the abdominal bracing and focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While in the lunge position simultaneously bend forward at your hips, while maintaining a flat back and contracting (squeezing) the glutes of the left (backward) leg, this will help increase the stretch in the left hip flexor muscles.

Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on a mat, placing the backs of your lower legs and heels on the top of a stability ball. Position your feet hip-width apart on the ball with your ankles slightly dorsiflexed (toes pointing towards the ceiling). Gently contract your abdominal/core muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this gentle muscle contraction throughout the exercise. Extend your arms out to your sides with palms turned to the floor to help stabilize your body during the exercise.
Step 2
Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and press your hips upwards off the floor into extension by contracting your glutes (butt muscles). At the same time press the backs of your lower legs and heels into the ball for additional stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back. Continue to press upwards until your legs and hips are straight with your torso and legs in alignment.
Step 3
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly contract your hamstrings to move your heels towards your hips while plantar flexing (toes pointed away from your shines) your ankles to rest the soles of your feet on top of the ball. Continue to pull your heels towards hips, raising your hips further off the floor. Maintain a stable torso, keeping it parallel with your upper thighs.
Step 4
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position.
Step 5
Exercise Variation (1): To increase the balance challenge, move your feet closer together on the stability ball.
Step 6
Exercise Variation (2): To increase the balance challenge, move your arms towards your side or place them on your chest to reduce your stabilizing points of contact with the floor.
Step 7
Exercise Variation (3): To increase the balance challenge, raise one leg off the ball in the starting position and curl with one leg.
Avoid arching your lower back as your press your hips upward to the starting position. This can be achieved by contracting your abdominal muscles prior to lifting and keeping them engaged throughout the lift.', 'Stability Ball Hamstring Curl', 'Stability Ball', 'Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/59-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Stand with your feet feet hip-width apart, arms by your sides, depressing and retracting your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and "brace" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
Step 7
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can increase the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) Driving your arms behind you during the downward phase (illustrated), (2) driving your arms forward and upward during the jumping phase (illustrated), or (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phase.

Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip width apart, with the right foot slightly forward (the heel of the right foot should be parallel to the toes of the left foot), your body weight should be over the right foot, only the toes of the left foot should be touching the floor to help with balance and stabilization during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise. Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles ("bracing") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine, and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back and maintain this shoulder position throughout the exercise. 
 
Step 2
Downward Movement: Inhale and press the right foot into the ground so your weight is balanced between the ball, heel and outside edge of the foot (keep the toes of the left foot on the floor for support during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise).  Slowly begin to bend forward at the hips while maintaining the abdominal bracing to avoid shifting or rotation of your torso. Maintain a flat back and head alignment with your spine (or head extended slightly upwards). 
 
Step 3
Maintain a tall spine with the abdominals braced, push your weight back into your right hip while allowing the right knee to hinge, you can either hold your arms by your side (as pictured) or hold them out front as a counter-balance.  As you are lowering yourself, maintain your weight through the ball of the foot and heel of the stance (supporting) foot, keep the pelvis level and the hips aligned during the full range-of-motion of the exercise.   
Step 4
Upward Movement: keep your bodyweight in your right leg and foot, exhale and slowly push the right foot into the ground to start moving upwards (by extending your hip and knee) to return to the initial standing position, maintain the core bracing through the entire movement to help keep the hips level and control balance.
 
Step 5
Switch the stance (supporting) leg, and complete another set of repetitions on the other leg.
 
Step 6
Exercise Variation: As this technique is mastered, the exercise intensity can be progressed by (1) lifting the supporting leg off of the floor. This increases the need for balance and stabilization within the body; (2) adding external resistance by holding a dumbbell in one hand or a medicine ball in both hands; (3) bending over and / or lower the hips closer to the ground increasing your knee bend; and (4) standing on unstable surfaces (e.g., Airex pad).

Gently exhale and slowly press the knee of the crossed leg away from your body as illustrated without moving your hips or trunk.  This will increase the stretch in the outer thigh and hip muscles. Continue pushing your knee away from you until you reach the point of tension, avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain.  You may also use your hand to push the crossed knee away from you. 
Step 3
Hold this position for a moment then slowly rotate your hips towards the floor, bringing the sole of the elevated foot to rest firmly on the floor.  Avoid any rotation through your trunk or arching in your low back will performing this movement.
Step 4
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position.  Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then repeat to the opposite side.
Step 5
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 
To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and control movement at other segments of the body.  During this stretch, attempt to avoid any rotation or arching in your low back.', 'Leg Crossover Stretch', 'No Equipment', 'Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/231-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Set out cones approximately 5 yards apart, stand at the far left cone in an athletic ready position: feet hip-width apart, knees bent with your weight back in your flexed hips.  Engage the abdominals (bracing) to maintain spinal stability throughout the exercise.
 
Step 2
Maintain the athletic ready position with your hips bent, your chest over your knees and your nose over your toes with your weight balanced between being up on the balls of your feet and back in your hips; shift your weight towards your right and pick up your right foot while explosively pushing your left foot into the ground to start moving to your right.
 
Step 3
Maintain the athletic ready position while continuing to move to your right, picking up the right foot and placing it to the right while pushing the left foot into the ground to generate the force and momentum for the sideways movement.  Your feet should remain parallel with one another with the toes facing foward and your weight on the balls of your feet (keep the whole foot on the ground, but your weight should be forward over the front of your feet); the emphasis of this drill should be on rapid, quick foot actions for the sideways (lateral) shuffling.
 
Step 4
At the far cone maintain the athletic ready position while shifting your weight over your left leg and push off with the right foot to begin shuffling back to the original starting point.  As you shuffle back to your left, pick up the left foot and place it to the left while pushing offer with the right foot.  Ensure that your feet remain parallel with your toes pointing forward and focus on rapid, quick foot actions for the duration of the movement.
 
Step 5
Exercise Variation: Work with a coach or training partner to provide either visual cues: by signaling which direction to move with a hand gesture, e.g. pointing to the left to shuffle to the left; or verbal cues: by stating which direction to shuffle, e.g. stating "right" to shuffle to the right.

Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and "brace" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
 
Step 2
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and position your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
 
Step 3
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards through your lower extremity over the top of the first cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 4
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
 
Step 5
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity over the second cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
 
Step 8
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward, upward (towards an overhead position) and slightly sideways in your jumping direction during the jumping phases, (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases, (4) increasing the height of each cone or the spacing between each cone, or (5) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more cones and performing a greater number of jumps in each direction.

Hold your chest up and out, and tilt your head slightly up.
 
Step 2
Shift your weight backwards, bringing your glutes to your heels, while maintaining “bracing.” Keeping your arms close to your sides, allow your arms to move behind you, placing your fingertips lightly on the floor for support.  Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds for 2-4 repetitions.

Step 2
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, "brace" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine and keep your pelvis level (and stable).  Lean forward into your right hip while keeping your left knee pressed into the ground, do not allow your pelvis to rotate to the anterior (forward).  To increase the stretch to the left hip flexors, squeeze and contract the glute muscles of your left hip.
 
Step 3
Hold the stretch position for 30-45 seconds at a time for a total of 2-5 repetitions; try to move into the stretch a little deeper with each repetition, but be sure to keep your core braced to not allow the pelvis to rotate and lose the stretch.  Complete all repetitions on one side before alternating to the other hip.
 
Step 4  
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the stretch raise the left arm straight in the air and tilt slightly to the right side and you lean forward into the right hip; be sure to alternate sides.
Keep the abdominals engaged throughout the entire stretch, this will ensure that the pelvis remains level and will provide the greatest results from the stretch.  To reduce any soreness in the knee on the ground, place an Airex pad or a rolled-up stretch mat under the knee.', 'Kneeling Hip-flexor Stretch', 'No Equipment', 'Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/142-1.jpg');

Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor as you explode your arms forward and throw them up in the air reaching overhead to help create upwards momentum away from the ground.
 
Step 3
Extend all the way through the body to create a straight line from your toes up through you arms and out of your hands.  When landing, land on the mid-foot rolling backwards towards the heels.  Push your hips backwards and downwards to absorb the impacting (ground) forces associated with landing.  Attempt to land softly and quietly and avoid locking out your knees on the landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
Exercise Variation: To increase the level of difficulty do a knee tuck and pull your knees up towards your chest as you are jumping into the air.
 
Before jumping become familiar with the movement mechanics by doing a few squats where you squat back into your heels and sink into your hips with your arms extended behind you, stand up from the squat while swinging your arms forward and roll up on your toes, then sink back into your heels; repeat for 4-6 repetitions.', 'Jump and Reach', 'No Equipment', 'Butt/Hips, Legs - Calves and Shins, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/176-1.jpg');

Stand vertical so the bar makes contact with the back of your head, your thoracic spine (between your shoulder blades) and your sacrum (butt).
Step 2
Downward Phase: Gently exhale and begin the movement by shifting your weight onto your heels, then pushing your hips backwards towards the wall behind you and hinge forward at the hips. Move to an end position where your torso is midway between vertical and parallel to the floor allowing only slight movement (bending) at the knees throughout this movement.

Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the surface. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees and quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
 
Step 6
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
 
Step 7
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase (illustrated), (2) driving your arms forward or upward (illustrated) during the jumping phase, (3) driving your knees towards your chest (illustrated) during the jumping phase., or (4) increasing the height of the raised platform or box.
Learn first how to squat and perform regular squat jumps before attempting to perform box jumps. The height of the platform / box should not exceed your vertical jump height.', 'Box Jumps', 'Raised Platform/Box', 'Butt/Hips, Legs - Calves and Shins, Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/115-1.jpg');

Step 2
Gently exhale and extend your leg slowly by contracting your quads while pulling your toes downwards towards your body, this will increase the stretch in your hamstrings and calf muscles.  Do not allow any movement in your hips and low back during this stretch.

Starting Position: Begin in a three-point stance with the hips flexed, knees bent, right foot back, the left foot forward, the right hand should be placed on the ground and the left arm in full shoulder extension (the forward motion of the arm driving forward helps with acceleration). 
Step 2
Drive the left arm forward and the right arm backwards while picking up the right leg and driving the left leg in to the ground to use left leg triple extension (plantar flexion in the ankle combined with extension of the knee and hip) to create rapid acceleration by pushing off against the ground.
Step 3
Continue with a rapid forward run focusing on maintaining explosive arm drive combined with explosive leg drive creating triple extension.
Step 4
When approaching the center cone, drop the weight back into the hips (creating hip flexion) while maintaining a tall trunk with a straight spine to while placing the feet out in front of your center of mass to decelerate your forward momentum; use the left arm to touch the cone and ensure that you are in an athletic ready position and low enough with your hips to create explosive hip drive to move laterally to the next cone.
Step 5
Plant the right foot into the ground while simultaneously picking of the left foot to move to the left; when the right foot is on the ground in hip extension and the left foot is in the air to begin the movement to the left side, the left arm should be back in shoulder extension and the right arm forward in shoulder flexion.
Step 6
Pushing off the right foot, shuffle to the left towards the cone placed approximately 5 yards to the left of the center cone;  both feet should remain parallel and your body should maintain the athletic ready position with your weight back in your hips during the lateral shuffling motion. 
Step 7
At the left cone reach down with your left hand to touch the cone (this reach will ensure that you drop back into your hips); once you have touched the cone, drive the left foot into the ground and pick up the right foot to begin the lateral shuffling movement back to the right.
Step 8
Maintain the athletic ready position with your weight back in your hips, your chest lifted tall with a straight spine and as you are shuffling to the right continue to pick up the right foot while driving off the left foot to maintain the momentum back to the cone placed 10 yards away (the right cone should be 5 yards from the center cone).
Step 9
At the right cone reach down with the right hand to touch the cone, then drive the right foot into the ground and pick up the left foot in order to laterally shuffle back to the center cone; once at the center cone, drop back into the athletic ready position with the hips flexed and spine straight and tall and push the legs forward to move backwards in a backpedaling motion to return to the original starting position. 
Exercise Variation: Have a partner or coach stand at the center cone and provide either verbal or visual instructions on which way to shuffle: either point to the left to have the athlete/client shuffle to the left, or provide a verbal cue of left to have the client/athlete move to the left.  
Focus on staying low with a straight spine and flexed hips, this will ensure the ability to maintain balance and control through the entire drill.  The center cone should be approx. 10 yards from the initial starting cone, each side cone should be 5 yards from the center cone; the total distance of the drill should cover 40 yards; but the distance between the cones can be adjusted to make the drill more (longer distances) or less (shorter distances) challenging.', 'T Drill', 'Cones', 'Full Body/Integrated', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/171-1.jpg');

Upward Movement: Exhale and explode upwards pushing from your glutes performing the following sequence:
Driving your left knee forward and upward (allow the knee-bend to open up slightly).
Driving your left arm backwards from your shoulders, while maintaining the 90-degree bend in your elbow and arm squeezed against your side.

Step 3
Keep the left foot planted inside the ladder and pick up the right foot to move it to the outside of the ladder, the right foot should be planted to the side and forward of the square where the left foot remains (the movement of the drill requires a zig-zag pattern which requires both lateral and forward movement).

Step 5
Close-up: both feet are planted inside the ladder, maintain an athletic ready position with the hips flexed, spine straight and tall and the eyes looking straight ahead (not pictured).
Step 6
Close-up: when both feet are next to each other in the square, pick up the right foot and plant it on the outside of the ladder in order to push off with right foot and pick up the left foot to move it forward to the next square in the ladder.  The drill should create a zig-zag pattern which is a combination of both forward and lateral movement; the foot pattern is: in-in-out-in-in-out (right foot in the square-left foot in the square-right foot outside the square with the left foot picked up and moved forward to the next square, when it is on the ground the right foot is picked up from the outside of the square and brought into the square next to the left; the left foot is then planted on the outside of the square and the right foot moved forward to the next square).

Exercise Variation: When learning the drill, you can plant just one foot on the outside of the ladder, as you improve your skill and speed, you can bring both feet outside the ladder-plant the right foot, then bring the left foot outside the ladder to hit the ground next to the right before being moved to the next forward square.  Another variation is to keep your eyes off of your feet and looking straight ahead where your opponent would be during an athletic competition. 
Keep your hips flexed with a tall, straight spine to ensure the athletic position throughout the entire range-of-motion of the drill.', 'Multidirectional Ladder Drill', 'Ladder', 'Full Body/Integrated', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/172-1.jpg');

Step 3
Push your left leg into triple extension (think about pushing the ground away from you) explosively drive the right knee straight up while maintaining a tall, straight spine; when the right knee is raised, the left arm should be forward in shoulder flexion and the right arm should be back in shoulder extension.
 
Step 4
Plant the right foot in the next square forward, explosively drive the right foot into the ground to create triple extension with the right leg while explosively lifting the left knee up towards the chest; maintain a tall, straight spine while explosively driving the arms into shoulder flexion and extension to help maintain the forward momentum. 
 
Step 5
Bring the left foot down and place it in the next square forward and explode into triple extension with the left leg while driving the right knee straight up; continue running forward down the ladder placing one foot in each square and emphasizing explosive leg action to rapidly move into triple extension each time you are pushing off and moving forward; keep your chest lifted, your spine straight and tall and use explosive arm swings to help maintain forward momentum through the course of the ladder.

Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, then gently exhale and slowly bend forward from your hips, lowering your elbows to rest against the inside of your thighs and push the thighs downward.  Attempt to maintain a flat back position, avoid rounding your back towards the ceiling (i.e., move from the hips and not your low back) and keep you head aligned with your spine.  This should create a stretch through your inner thighs. 
 
Step 3
Continue to press downward to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain.  Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds, then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times.  You may elect to grasp your ankles to hold this position.
Step 4
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
 
To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bounding, and control movement at other segments of the body.', 'Seated Butterfly Stretch', 'No Equipment', 'Legs - Thighs', 'https://ik.imagekit.io/02fmeo4exvw/exercise-library/large/216-1.jpg');

Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) on a mat and attach a cuff (cable or band resistance) to one ankle with the anchor or resistance point away from your body. Lie with feet hip-width apart. Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles ("bracing") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine. Keep your ankle lightly dorsi-flexed (toes pointed towards your shinbone) throughout the exercise.  

Step 2
Curling Movement: Exhale and curl (bend) your knee, bringing your heel towards your buttock without moving your thigh (the top of your thigh remains on the mat), lifting your hips off the mat or arching your low back. 

Step 3
Continue bending your knee until your heels near, or touch your buttock, or you reach the limits of your comfort level. The point where you notice your hips or low-back beginning to move indicates that you have reached the limits of movement in your joint.  

Step 4
Downward Movement: Inhale and slowly return your leg back to your starting position.

Step 5
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be increased by (1) increasing your range of motion by moving your heel closer to your buttock or (2) increasing the resistance in the cable / band.
